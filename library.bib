The propensity of metastatic prostate cancer to spread to the bone has limited repeated sampling of tumor deposits. Hence, considerably less is understood about this lethal metastatic disease, as it is not commonly studied. Here we explored whole-genome sequencing of plasma DNA to scan the tumor genomes of these patients non-invasively.

abstract = {DNA methylation is crucial for a wide variety of biological processes, yet no technique suitable for the methylome analysis of DNA methylation at single-cell resolution is available. Here, we describe a methylome analysis technique that enables single-cell and single-base resolution DNA methylation analysis based on reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (scRRBS). The technique is highly sensitive and can detect the methylation status of up to 1.5 million CpG sites within the genome of an individual mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC). Moreover, we show that the technique can detect the methylation status of individual CpG sites in a haploid sperm cell in a digitized manner as either unmethylated or fully methylated. Furthermore, we show that the demethylation dynamics of maternal and paternal genomes after fertilization can be traced within the individual pronuclei of mouse zygotes. The demethylation process of the genic regions is faster than that of the intergenic regions in both male and female pronuclei. Our method paves the way for the exploration of the dynamic methylome landscapes of individual cells at single-base resolution during physiological processes such as embryonic development, or during pathological processes such as tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {The accurate identification of rare antigen-specific cytokine positive cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after antigenic stimulation in an intracellular staining (ICS) flow cytometry assay is challenging, as cytokine positive events may be fairly diffusely distributed and lack an obvious separation from the negative population. Traditionally, the approach by flow operators has been to manually set a positivity threshold to partition events into cytokine-positive and cytokine-negative. This approach suffers from subjectivity and inconsistency across different flow operators. The use of statistical clustering methods does not remove the need to find an objective threshold between positive and negative events since consistent identification of rare event subsets is highly challenging for automated algorithms, especially when there is distributional overlap between the positive and negative events (“smear”). We present a new approach, based on the F$\beta$ measure, which is similar to manual thresholding in providing a hard cutoff, but has the advantage of being determined objectively. We first show that visually determined thresholds are difficult to reproduce and pose a problem when comparing results across operators or laboratories, as well as problems that occur with the use of commonly employed clustering algorithms. In contrast, a single parameterization for the F$\beta$ method performs consistently across different centers, samples, and instruments because it optimizes the precision/recall tradeoff by using both negative and positive controls. The performance of this algorithm is compared with results obtained by expert visual gating. Several ICS data sets from the External Quality Assurance Program Oversight Laboratory (EQAPOL) proficiency program were used to make the comparisons.},

abstract = {Author SummaryThe use of flow cytometry to count antigen-specific T cells is essential for vaccine development, monitoring of immune-based therapies and immune biomarker discovery. Analysis of such data is challenging because antigen-specific cells are often present in frequencies of less than 1 in 1,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Standard analysis of flow cytometry data relies on visual identification of cell subsets by experts, a process that is subjective and often difficult to reproduce. Consequently, there is intense interest in automated approaches for cell subset identification. One popular class of such automated approaches is the use of statistical mixture models. We propose a hierarchical extension of statistical mixture models that has two advantages over standard mixture models. First, it increases the ability to detect extremely rare event clusters that are present in multiple samples. Second, it enables direct comparison of cell subsets by aligning clusters across multiple samples in a natural way arising from the hierarchical formulation. We demonstrate the algorithm on clinically relevant reference PBMC samples with known frequencies of CD8 T cells engineered to express T cell receptors specific for the cancer-testis antigen (NY-ESO-1) and compare its performance with other popular automated analysis approaches.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20–23 nt) RNAs that are sequence-specific mediators of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Modern high-throughput technologies enable deep sequencing of such RNA species on an unprecedented scale. We find that the analysis of small RNA deep-sequencing libraries can be affected by cross-mapping, in which RNA sequences originating from one locus are inadvertently mapped to another. Similar to cross-hybridization on microarrays, cross-mapping is prevalent among miRNAs, as they tend to occur in families, are similar or derived from repeat or structural RNAs, or are post-transcriptionally modified. Here, we develop a strategy to correct for cross-mapping, and apply it to the analysis of RNA editing in mature miRNAs. In contrast to previous reports, our analysis suggests that RNA editing in mature miRNAs is rare in animals.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Qualitative and quantitative analysis of small non-coding RNAs by next generation sequencing (smallRNA-Seq) represents a novel technology increasingly used to investigate with high sensitivity and specificity RNA population comprising microRNAs and other regulatory small transcripts. Analysis of smallRNA-Seq data to gather biologically relevant information, i.e. detection and differential expression analysis of known and novel non-coding RNAs, target prediction, etc., requires implementation of multiple statistical and bioinformatics tools from different sources, each focusing on a specific step of the analysis pipeline. As a consequence, the analytical workflow is slowed down by the need for continuous interventions by the operator, a critical factor when large numbers of datasets need to be analyzed at once.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We designed a novel modular pipeline (iMir) for comprehensive analysis of smallRNA-Seq data, comprising specific tools for adapter trimming, quality filtering, differential expression analysis, biological target prediction and other useful options by integrating multiple open source modules and resources in an automated workflow. As statistics is crucial in deep-sequencing data analysis, we devised and integrated in iMir tools based on different statistical approaches to allow the operator to analyze data rigorously. The pipeline created here proved to be efficient and time-saving than currently available methods and, in addition, flexible enough to allow the user to select the preferred combination of analytical steps. We present here the results obtained by applying this pipeline to analyze simultaneously 6 smallRNA-Seq datasets from either exponentially growing or growth-arrested human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, that led to the rapid and accurate identification, quantitation and differential expression analysis of {\~{}}450 miRNAs, including several novel miRNAs and isomiRs, as well as identification of the putative mRNA targets of differentially expressed miRNAs. In addition, iMir allowed also the identification of {\~{}}70 piRNAs (piwi-interacting RNAs), some of which differentially expressed in proliferating vs growth arrested cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The integrated data analysis pipeline described here is based on a reliable, flexible and fully automated workflow, useful to rapidly and efficiently analyze high-throughput smallRNA-Seq data, such as those produced by the most recent high-performance next generation sequencers. iMir is available at http://www.labmedmolge.unisa.it/inglese/research/imir.},

We demonstrate the power of the approach by reconstructing the chromosomal organization of the gene space of barley, a large, complex and highly repetitive 5.1 Gb genome. We evaluate the robustness of the new assembly by comparison to a recently released physical and genetic framework of the barley genome, and to various genetically ordered sequence-based genotypic datasets.

Tools for single-cell proteomics have developed rapidly over the past 5 years and are providing approaches for directly elucidating phosphoprotein signaling networks in cancer cells or for capturing high-resolution snapshots of immune system function in patients with various disease conditions. We discuss advances in single-cell proteomics platforms, with an emphasis on microchip methods. These methods can provide a direct correlation of morphological, functional and molecular signatures at the single-cell level. We also provide examples of how those platforms are being applied to both fundamental biology and clinical studies, focusing on immune-system monitoring and phosphoprotein signaling networks in cancer.

abstract = {Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) is a powerful method of DNA methylome profiling that can be applied to single cells. However, no previous report has described how PCR-based duplication-induced artifacts affect the accuracy of this method when measuring DNA methylation levels. For quantifying the effects of duplication-induced artifacts on methylome profiling when using ultra-trace amounts of starting material, we developed a novel method, namely quantitative RRBS (Q-RRBS), in which PCR-induced duplication is excluded through the use of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). By performing Q-RRBS on varying amounts of starting material, we determined that duplication-induced artifacts were more severe when small quantities of the starting material were used. However, through using the UMIs, we successfully eliminated these artifacts. In addition, Q-RRBS could accurately detect allele-specific methylation in absence of allele-specific genetic variants. Our results demonstrate that Q-RRBS is an optimal strategy for DNA methylation profiling of single cells or samples containing ultra-trace amounts of cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical flow cytometry typically involves the sequential
interpretation of two-dimensional histograms, usually culled from
six or more cellular characteristics, following initial selection
(gating) of cell populations based on a different subset of these
characteristics. We examined the feasibility of instead treating
gated n-parameter clinical flow cytometry data as objects embedded
in n-dimensional space using principles of information geometry via
a recently described method known as Fisher Information Non-parametric
Embedding (FINE). METHODS: After initial selection of relevant cell
populations through an iterative gating strategy, we converted four
color (six-parameter) clinical flow cytometry datasets into six-dimensional
probability density functions, and calculated differences among these
distributions using the Kullback-Leibler divergence (a measurement
of relative distributional entropy shown to be an appropriate approximation
of Fisher information distance in certain types of statistical manifolds).
Neighborhood maps based on Kullback-Leibler divergences were projected
onto two dimensional displays for comparison. RESULTS: These methods
resulted in the effective unsupervised clustering of cases of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia from cases of expansion of physiologic B-cell
precursors (hematogones) within a set of 54 patient samples. CONCLUSIONS:
The treatment of flow cytometry datasets as objects embedded in high-dimensional
space (as opposed to sequential two-dimensional analyses) harbors
the potential for use as a decision-support tool in clinical practice
or as a means for context-based archiving and searching of clinical
flow cytometry data based on high-dimensional distribution patterns
contained within stored list mode data. Additional studies will be
needed to further test the effectiveness of this approach in clinical
practice. (c) 2008 Clinical Cytometry Society.},

abstract = {Small RNA RNA-seq for microRNAs (miRNAs) is a rapidly developing field where opportunities still exist to create better bioinformatics tools to process these large datasets and generate new, useful analyses. We built miRge to be a fast, smart small RNA-seq solution to process samples in a highly multiplexed fashion. miRge employs a Bayesian alignment approach, whereby reads are sequentially aligned against customized mature miRNA, hairpin miRNA, noncoding RNA and mRNA sequence libraries. miRNAs are summarized at the level of raw reads in addition to reads per million (RPM). Reads for all other RNA species (tRNA, rRNA, snoRNA, mRNA) are provided, which is useful for identifying potential contaminants and optimizing small RNA purification strategies. miRge was designed to optimally identify miRNA isomiRs and employs an entropy based statistical measurement to identify differential production of isomiRs. This allowed us to identify decreasing entropy in isomiRs as stem cells mature into retinal pigment epithelial cells. Conversely, we show that pancreatic tumor miRNAs have similar entropy to matched normal pancreatic tissues. In a head-to-head comparison with other miRNA analysis tools (miRExpress 2.0, sRNAbench, omiRAs, miRDeep2, Chimira, UEA small RNA Workbench), miRge was faster (4 to 32-fold) and was among the top-two methods in maximally aligning miRNAs reads per sample. Moreover, miRge has no inherent limits to its multiplexing. miRge was capable of simultaneously analyzing 100 small RNA-Seq samples in 52 minutes, providing an integrated analysis of miRNA expression across all samples. As miRge was designed for analysis of single as well as multiple samples, miRge is an ideal tool for high and low-throughput users. miRge is freely available at http://atlas.pathology.jhu.edu/baras/miRge.html.},

Sequencing MALBAC-amplified DNA achieves 93{\%} genome coverage ≥1x for a single human cell at 25x mean sequencing depth. We detected digitized copy-number variations (CNVs) of a single cancer cell. By sequencing three kindred cells, we were able to identify individual single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), with no false positives detected. We directly measured the genome-wide mutation rate of a cancer cell line and found that purine-pyrimidine exchanges occurred unusually frequently among the newly acquired SNVs.},

abstract = {Author Summary 
An association study examines a phenotype against genotypic variations over a large set of individuals in order to find the genetic variant that gives rise to the variation in the phenotype. Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related clinical phenotypes, and the patient cohorts are routinely surveyed with a large number of traits, such as hundreds of clinical phenotypes and genome-wide profiling of thousands of gene expressions, many of which are correlated. However, most of the conventional approaches for association mapping or eQTL analysis consider a single phenotype at a time instead of taking advantage of the relatedness of traits by analyzing them jointly. Assuming that a group of tightly correlated traits may share a common genetic basis, in this paper, we present a new framework for association analysis that searches for genetic variations influencing a group of correlated traits. We explicitly represent the correlation information in multiple quantitative traits as a quantitative trait network and directly incorporate this network information to scan the genome for association. Our results on simulated and asthma data show that our approach has a significant advantage in detecting associations when a genetic marker perturbs synergistically a group of traits.},

abstract = {Motivation: Deep profiling the phenotypic landscape of tissues using high-throughput flow cytometry (FCM) can provide important new insights into the interplay of cells in both healthy and diseased tissue. But often, especially in clinical settings, the cytometer cannot measure all the desired markers in a single aliquot. In these cases, tissue is separated into independently analysed samples, leaving a need to electronically recombine these to increase dimensionality. Nearest-neighbour (NN) based imputation fulfils this need but can produce artificial subpopulations. Clustering-based NNs can reduce these, but requires prior domain knowledge to be able to parameterize the clustering, so is unsuited to discovery settings. Results: We present flowBin, a parameterization-free method for combining multitube FCM data into a higher-dimensional form suitable for deep profiling and discovery. FlowBin allocates cells to bins defined by the common markers across tubes in a multitube experiment, then computes aggregate expression for each bin within each tube, to create a matrix of expression of all markers assayed in each tube. We show, using simulated multitube data, that flowType analysis of flowBin output reproduces the results of that same analysis on the original data for cell types of {\textgreater}10{\%} abundance. We used flowBin in conjunction with classifiers to distinguish normal from cancerous cells. We used flowBin together with flowType and RchyOptimyx to profile the immunophenotypic landscape of NPM1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia, and present a series of novel cell types associated with that mutation.

leukemia (B-CLL), clinically more aggressive lymphoplasmocytoid immunocytoma

B-cell type by automated analysis of flow cytometric immunophenotypes
CD45/14/20, CD4/8/3, kappa/CD19/5, lambda/CD19/5 and CD10/23/19 from
peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate leukocytes using the multiparameter
classification program CLASSIF1. The immunophenotype list mode files
were exhaustively evaluated by combined lymphocyte, monocyte, and
granulocyte (LMG) analysis. The results were introduced into databases
and automatically classified in a standardized way. The resulting
triple matrix classifiers are laboratory and instrument independent,
error tolerant, and robust in the classification of unknown test
samples. Practically 100{\%} correct individual patient classification
was achievable, and most manually unclassifiable patients were unambiguously
classified. It is of interest that the single lambda/CD19/5 antibody
triplet provided practically the same information as the full set
of the five antibody triplets. This demonstrates that standardized
classification can be used to optimize immunophenotype panels. On-line
classification of test samples is accessible on the Internet: http://www.biochem.mpg.de/valet/leukaem1.html
Immunophenotype panels are usually devised for the detection of the
frequency of abnormal cell populations. As shown by computer classification,
most the highly discriminant information is, however, not contained
in percentage frequency values of cell populations, but rather in
total antibody binding, antibody binding ratios, and relative antibody
surface density parameters of various lymphocyte, monocyte, and granulocyte
cell populations.},

We also present a set of methods for annotating sequences deriving from known miRNAs, identifying variability in mature miRNA sequences, and identifying sequences belonging to previously unidentified miRNA genes. Application of this approach to RNA from human embryonic stem cells obtained before and after their differentiation into embryoid bodies revealed the sequences and expression levels of 334 known plus 104 novel miRNA genes. One hundred seventy-one known and 23 novel microRNA sequences exhibited significant expression differences between these two developmental states. Owing to the increased number of sequence reads, these libraries represent the deepest miRNA sampling to date, spanning nearly six orders of magnitude of expression. The predicted targets of those miRNAs enriched in either sample shared common features. Included among the high-ranked predicted gene targets are those implicated in differentiation, cell cycle control, programmed cell death, and transcriptional regulation.},

abstract = {BackgroundRecent studies have provided a detailed census of genes that are mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Our next challenge is to understand how this genetic diversity defines the pathophysiology of AML and informs clinical practice. MethodsWe enrolled a total of 1540 patients in three prospective trials of intensive therapy. Combining driver mutations in 111 cancer genes with cytogenetic and clinical data, we defined AML genomic subgroups and their relevance to clinical outcomes. ResultsWe identified 5234 driver mutations across 76 genes or genomic regions, with 2 or more drivers identified in 86{\%} of the patients. Patterns of co-mutation compartmentalized the cohort into 11 classes, each with distinct diagnostic features and clinical outcomes. In addition to currently defined AML subgroups, three heterogeneous genomic categories emerged: AML with mutations in genes encoding chromatin, RNA-splicing regulators, or both (in 18{\%} of patients); AML with TP53 mutations, chromosomal aneuploidies, or b...},

abstract = {Cytometry is used extensively in clinical and laboratory settings to diagnose and track cell subsets in blood and tissue. High-throughput, single-cell approaches leveraging cytometry are developed and applied in the computational and systems biology communities by researchers, who seek to improve the diagnosis of human diseases, map the structures of cell signaling networks, and identify new cell types. Data analysis and management present a bottleneck in the flow of knowledge from bench to clinic. Multi-parameter flow and mass cytometry enable identification of signaling profiles of patient cell samples. Currently, this process is manual, requiring hours of work to summarize multi-dimensional data and translate these data for input into other analysis programs. In addition, the increase in the number and size of collaborative cytometry studies as well as the computational complexity of analytical tools require the ability to assemble sufficient and appropriately configured computing capacity on demand. There is a critical need for platforms that can be used by both clinical and basic researchers who routinely rely on cytometry. Recent advances provide a unique opportunity to facilitate collaboration and analysis and management of cytometry data. Specifically, advances in cloud computing and virtualization are enabling efficient use of large computing resources for analysis and backup. An example is Cytobank, a platform that allows researchers to annotate, analyze, and share results along with the underlying single-cell data.},

abstract = {Dynamically regulated changes in chromatin states are vital for normal development and can produce disease when they go awry. Accordingly, much effort has been devoted to characterizing these states under normal and pathological conditions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the most widely used method to characterize where in the genome transcription factors, modified histones, modified nucleotides and chromatin binding proteins are found; bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) and its variants are commonly used to characterize the locations of DNA modifications. Though very powerful, these methods are not without limitations. Notably, they are best at characterizing one chromatin feature at a time, yet chromatin features arise and function in combination. Investigators commonly superimpose separate ChIP-seq or BS-seq datasets, and then infer where chromatin features are found together. While these inferences might be correct, they can be misleading when the chromatin source has distinct cell types, or when a given cell type exhibits any cell to cell variation in chromatin state. These ambiguities can be eliminated by robust methods that directly characterize the existence and genomic locations of combinations of chromatin features in very small inputs of cells or ideally, single cells. Here we review single molecule epigenomic methods under development to overcome these limitations, the technical challenges associated with single molecule methods and their potential application to single cells.},

abstract = {Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been thought to be the consequence of two broad complementation classes of mutations: class I and class II. However, overlap-mutations between them or within the same class and the position of TP53 mutation are not fully analyzed. We comprehensively analyzed the FLT3, cKIT, N-RAS, C/EBPA, AML1, MLL, NPM1, and TP53 mutations in 144 newly diagnosed de novo AML. We found 103 of 165 identified mutations were overlapped with other mutations, and most overlap-mutations consisted of class I and class II mutations. Although overlap-mutations within the same class were found in seven patients, five of them additionally had the other class mutation. These results suggest that most overlap-mutations within the same class might be the consequence of acquiring an additional mutation after the completion both of class I and class II mutations. However, mutated genes overlapped with the same class were limited in N-RAS, TP53, MLL-PTD, and NPM1, suggesting the possibility that these irregular overlap-mutations might cooperatively participate in the development of AML. Notably, TP53 mutation was overlapped with both class I and class II mutations, and associated with morphologic multilineage dysplasia and complex karyotype. The genotype consisting of complex karyotype and TP53 mutation was an unfavorable prognostic factor in entire AML patients, indicating this genotype generates a disease entity in de novo AML. These results collectively suggest that TP53 mutation might be a functionally distinguishable class of mutation.},

Such epigenomic studies represent a broader category of disease -omics, which suffer from multiple problems in design and execution that severely limit their interpretability.

abstract = {The increased use of Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSC) to reconstitute hematopoiesis in autotransplant and, more recently, allotransplant settings has not been associated with a consensus means to quality control the PBSC product. Since the small population of cells that bear the CD34 antigen are thought to be responsible for multilineage engraftment, graft assessment by flow cytometric quantitation of CD34+ cells should provide a rapid, reliable, and reproducible assay. Unfortunately, although a number of flow cytometric assays for CD34 enumeration have been described, the lack of a standardized method has led to the generation of widely divergent data. Furthermore, none of these assays has been validated as to interlaboratory reproducibility and suitability for widespread clinical application. In early 1995, the International Society of Hematotherapy and Graft Engineering (ISHAGE) established a Stem Cell Enumeration Committee, the mandate of which was to validate a simple, rapid, and sensitive flow cytometric method to quantitate CD34+ cells in peripheral blood and apheresis products. We also sought to establish its utility on a variety of flow cytometers in clinical laboratories and its reproducibility between transplant centers. Here, we describe the four-parameter flow methodology adopted by ISHAGE for validation in a multicenter study in North America.},

abstract = {Background and Objectives ACPA+ individuals with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms are at high risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We previously demonstrated dys-regulation of T-cell subsets with loss of na{\"{i}}ve and regulatory T-cells (Treg) in early disease. The aim of the current study is to demonstrate the predictive value of T-cell subset analysis for progression towards symptom onset in ACPA+ individuals.
Materials and Methods 84 ACPA+ individuals without clinical synovitis at recruitment were followed. 95 healthy controls (HC) provided a reference group. At baseline T-cell subset analyses were performed using 6-colour flowcytometry for na{\"{i}}ve T-cells (CD4+ CD45RB + CD45RA+ CD62L+), Treg (CD4+ CD25highFoxp3 + CD127low) and inflammation related cells (IRC: CD4+ CD45RB + CD45RA+ CD62L-). The relationship between na{\"{i}}ve cell frequency and age was established in HC and used to age-correct values in ACPA+ . ROC curve analysis was used to identify 2 T-cell cut-offs predicting progression to IA at any time; one which maximised the Youden index (sensitivity + specificity-1), and one which prioritised specificity over sensitivity.
Results 42/84 (50{\%}) of patients developed clinical synovitis within a median follow-up of 6.0 months (range 1 week-46 months). For age-corrected na{\"{i}}ve T-cells area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.67 (95{\%} CI 0.55, 0.79; n = 84, p = 0.007), for IRC 0.70 (0.59, 0.81; n = 81, p = 0.002) and for Treg 0.67 (0.53, 0.80; n = 65, p = 0.021). For each of the three subsets, the Youden index cut-off correctly classified {\textgreater}65{\%} of patients (Table 1). Cut-offs prioritising specificity were identified which did not greatly reduce overall classification success. The confidence intervals for these estimates remain wide and our sample size may still be limited for running such analysis. View this table: In this window In a new window

Conclusions T-cell dys-regulation in ACPA+ individuals with non-specific musculoskeletal pain may be useful in predicting progression to inflammatory arthritis. Multivariable modelling in larger cohorts is needed to quantify the utility of T-cell subsets in predicting progression to IA.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Qualitative and quantitative analysis of small non-coding RNAs by next generation sequencing (smallRNA-Seq) represents a novel technology increasingly used to investigate with high sensitivity and specificity RNA population comprising microRNAs and other regulatory small transcripts. Analysis of smallRNA-Seq data to gather biologically relevant information, i.e. detection and differential expression analysis of known and novel non-coding RNAs, target prediction, etc., requires implementation of multiple statistical and bioinformatics tools from different sources, each focusing on a specific step of the analysis pipeline. As a consequence, the analytical workflow is slowed down by the need for continuous interventions by the operator, a critical factor when large numbers of datasets need to be analyzed at once.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We designed a novel modular pipeline (iMir) for comprehensive analysis of smallRNA-Seq data, comprising specific tools for adapter trimming, quality filtering, differential expression analysis, biological target prediction and other useful options by integrating multiple open source modules and resources in an automated workflow. As statistics is crucial in deep-sequencing data analysis, we devised and integrated in iMir tools based on different statistical approaches to allow the operator to analyze data rigorously. The pipeline created here proved to be efficient and time-saving than currently available methods and, in addition, flexible enough to allow the user to select the preferred combination of analytical steps. We present here the results obtained by applying this pipeline to analyze simultaneously 6 smallRNA-Seq datasets from either exponentially growing or growth-arrested human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, that led to the rapid and accurate identification, quantitation and differential expression analysis of {\~{}}450 miRNAs, including several novel miRNAs and isomiRs, as well as identification of the putative mRNA targets of differentially expressed miRNAs. In addition, iMir allowed also the identification of {\~{}}70 piRNAs (piwi-interacting RNAs), some of which differentially expressed in proliferating vs growth arrested cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The integrated data analysis pipeline described here is based on a reliable, flexible and fully automated workflow, useful to rapidly and efficiently analyze high-throughput smallRNA-Seq data, such as those produced by the most recent high-performance next generation sequencers. iMir is available at http://www.labmedmolge.unisa.it/inglese/research/imir.},

abstract = {MicroRNA (miRs) represent a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs playing a major role in the control of gene expression by repressing protein synthesis at the post-transcriptional level. Studies carried out during the last years have shown that some miRNAs plays a key role in the control of normal and malignant hgematopoiesis. In this review we focus on recent progress in analyzing the functional role of miR-146a in the control of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. On the other hand, this miRNA has shown to impact in the control of innate immune responses. Finally, many recent studies indicate a deregulation of miR-146 in many solid tumors and gene knockout studies indicate a role for this miRNA as a tumor suppressor.

abstract = {Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with mutated NPM1 shows distinctive biologic
and clinical features, including absent/low CD34 expression, the
significance of which remains unclear. Therefore, we analyzed CD34+
cells from 41 NPM1-mutated AML. At flow cytometry, 31 of 41 samples
contained less than 10{\%} cells showing low intensity CD34 positivity
and variable expression of CD38. Mutational analysis and/or Western
blotting of purified CD34+ cells from 17 patients revealed NPM1-mutated
gene and/or protein in all. Immunohistochemistry of trephine bone
marrow biopsies and/or flow cytometry proved CD34+ leukemia cells
from NPM1-mutated AML had aberrant nucleophosmin expression in cytoplasm.
NPM1-mutated gene and/or protein was also confirmed in a CD34+ subfraction
exhibiting the phenotype (CD34+/CD38–/CD123+/CD33+/CD90–) of leukemic
stem cells. When transplanted into immunocompromised mice, CD34+
cells generated a leukemia recapitulating, both morphologically and
immunohistochemically (aberrant cytoplasmic nucleophosmin, CD34 negativity),
the original patient's disease. These results indicate that the CD34+
fraction in NPM1-mutated AML belongs to the leukemic clone and contains
NPM1-mutated cells exhibiting properties typical of leukemia-initiating
cells. CD34– cells from few cases (2/15) also showed significant
leukemia-initiating cell potential in immunocompromised mice. This
study provides further evidence that NPM1 mutation is a founder genetic
lesion and has potential implications for the cell-of-origin and
targeted therapy of NPM1-mutated AML.},

abstract = {Background
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised learning technique that has been applied successfully in several fields, including signal processing, face recognition and text mining. Recent applications of NMF in bioinformatics have demonstrated its ability to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional data such as gene expression microarrays. Developments in NMF theory and applications have resulted in a variety of algorithms and methods. However, most NMF implementations have been on commercial platforms, while those that are freely available typically require programming skills. This limits their use by the wider research community.

Results
Our objective is to provide the bioinformatics community with an open-source, easy-to-use and unified interface to standard NMF algorithms, as well as with a simple framework to help implement and test new NMF methods. For that purpose, we have developed a package for the R/BioConductor platform. The package ports public code to R, and is structured to enable users to easily modify and/or add algorithms. It includes a number of published NMF algorithms and initialization methods and facilitates the combination of these to produce new NMF strategies. Commonly used benchmark data and visualization methods are provided to help in the comparison and interpretation of the results.

Conclusions
The NMF package helps realize the potential of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, especially in bioinformatics, providing easy access to methods that have already yielded new insights in many applications. Documentation, source code and sample data are available from CRAN.},

abstract = {The enumeration of absolute levels of cells and their subsets in clinical samples is of primary importance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)+ individuals (CD4+ T- lymphocyte enumeration), in patients who are candidates for autotransplantation (CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells), and in evaluating leukoreduced blood products (residual white blood cells). These measurements share a number of technical options, namely, single- or multiple-color cell staining and logical gating strategies. These can be accomplished using single- or dual-platform counting technologies employing cytometric methods. Dual-platform counting technologies couple the percentage of positive cell subsets obtained by cytometry and the absolute cell count obtained by automated hematology analyzers to derive the absolute value of such subsets. Despite having many conceptual and technical limitations, this approach is traditionally considered as the reference method for absolute cell count enumeration. As a result, the development of single-platform technologies has recently attracted attention with several different technical approaches now being readily available. These single-platform approaches have less sources of variability. A number of reports clearly demonstrate that they provide better coefficients of variation (CVs) in multicenter studies and a lower chance to generate aberrant results. These methods are therefore candidates for the new gold standard for absolute cell assessments. The currently available technical options are discussed in this review together with the results of some cross-comparative studies. Each analytical system has its own specific requirements as far as the dispensing precision steps are concerned. The importance of precision reverse pipetting is emphasized. Issues still under development include the establishment of the critical error ranges, which are different in each test setting, and the applicability of simplified low-cost techniques to be used in countries with limited resources.

abstract = {Recent single-cell analysis technologies offer an unprecedented opportunity to elucidate developmental pathways. Here we present Wishbone, an algorithm for positioning single cells along bifurcating developmental trajectories with high resolution. Wishbone uses multi-dimensional single-cell data, such as mass cytometry or RNA-Seq data, as input and orders cells according to their developmental progression, and it pinpoints bifurcation points by labeling each cell as pre-bifurcation or as one of two post-bifurcation cell fates. Using 30-channel mass cytometry data, we show that Wishbone accurately recovers the known stages of T-cell development in the mouse thymus, including the bifurcation point. We also apply the algorithm to mouse myeloid differentiation and demonstrate its generalization to additional lineages. A comparison of Wishbone to diffusion maps, SCUBA and Monocle shows that it outperforms these methods both in the accuracy of ordering cells and in the correct identification of branch points.},

abstract = {Mass cytometry is a recently introduced technology that utilizes transition element isotope-tagged antibodies for protein detection on a single-cell basis. By circumventing the limitations of emission spectral overlap associated with fluorochromes utilized in traditional flow cytometry, mass cytometry currently allows measurement of up to 40 parameters per cell. Recently a comprehensive mass cytometry analysis was described for the hematopoietic differentiation program in human bone marrow from a healthy donor. The present study describes approaches to delineate cell cycle stages utilizing iododeoxyuridine (IdU) to mark cells in S phase, simultaneously with antibodies against cyclin B1, cyclin A, and phosphorylated histone H3 (S28) that characterize the other cell cycle phases. Protocols were developed in which an antibody against phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (Rb) at serines 807 and 811 was used to separate cells in G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle. This mass cytometry method yielded cell cycle distributions of both normal and cancer cell populations that were equivalent to those obtained by traditional fluorescence cytometry techniques. We applied this to map the cell cycle phases of cells spanning the hematopoietic hierarchy in healthy human bone marrow as a prelude to later studies with cancers and other disorders of this lineage.},

@article{Loher2014,
abstract = {For many years it was believed that each mature microRNA (miRNA) existed as a single entity with fixed endpoints and a 'static' and unchangeable primary sequence. However, recent evidence suggests that mature miRNAs are more 'dynamic' and that each miRNA precursor arm gives rise to multiple isoforms, the isomiRs. Here we report on our identification of numerous and abundant isomiRs in the lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) of 452 men and women from five different population groups. Unexpectedly, we find that these isomiRs exhibit an expression profile that is population-dependent and gender-dependent. This is important as it indicates that the LCLs of each gender/population combination have their own unique collection of mature miRNA transcripts. Moreover, each identified isomiR has its own characteristic abundance that remains consistent across biological replicates indicating that these are not degradation products. The primary sequences of identified isomiRs differ from the known miRBase miRNA either at their 5´-endpoint (leads to a different 'seed' sequence and suggests a different targetome), their 3´-endpoint, or both simultaneously. Our analysis of Argonaute PAR-CLIP data from LCLs supports the association of many of these newly identified isomiRs with the Argonaute silencing complex and thus their functional roles through participation in the RNA interference pathway.},

abstract = {The functional potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) declines during aging, and in doing so, significantly contributes to hematopoietic pathophysiology in the elderly. To explore the relationship between age-associated HSC decline and the epigenome, we examined global DNA methylation of HSCs during ontogeny in combination with functional analysis. Although the DNA methylome is generally stable during aging, site-specific alterations of DNA methylation occur at genomic regions associated with hematopoietic lineage potential and selectively target genes expressed in downstream progenitor and effector cells. We found that age-associated HSC decline, replicative limits, and DNA methylation are largely dependent on the proliferative history of HSCs, yet appear to be telomere-length independent. Physiological aging and experimentally enforced proliferation of HSCs both led to DNA hypermethylation of genes regulated by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2. Our results provide evidence that epigenomic alterations of the DNA methylation landscape contribute to the functional decline of HSCs during aging.},

abstract = {Objective
In vitro culture systems that parallel in vivo growth conditions are needed to study leukemia biology and to accurately test therapeutic efficacies. We investigated the effects of the HS-5 human bone marrow stromal cell line on cultured primary leukemia cell survival and chemosensitivity.
Materials and Methods
A total of 30 bone marrow (BM) samples from untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients were cultured for 96 hours with serum and growth factors, without HS-5, or in direct contact with HS-5 monolayers, or with HS-5 separated from AML cells by transwell inserts. In some experiments, cytosine arabinoside or daunomycin was added for the last 18 hours of culture. Apoptosis frequencies, bcl-2 protein expression, proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, and cell cycle distributions were determined in four-color flow cytometry analyses of CD45+ leukemia cells.
Results
In comparison to control growth conditions, direct contact with HS-5 significantly inhibited culture-induced and drug-induced apoptosis of AML cells. Direct contact of AML cells with HS-5 significantly increased short-term proliferation and viability, and colony formation of primary AML cells. HS-5–mediated apoptosis inhibition was not consistently associated with increased bcl-2 protein in AML cells. Noncontact conditions inhibited drug-induced apoptosis significantly less than direct contact with HS-5.
Conclusion
Coculture of AML cells on HS-5 monolayers improved in vitro leukemia cell survival and attenuated chemotherapy-induced leukemia cell killing. This has practical significance, increasing the fraction of primary AML samples that can be analyzed in vitro, and allows drug sensitivity testing in growth conditions more similar to the bone marrow microenvironment.},

To gain insights into this process, we generated base-pair-resolution mouse methylomes in stem cells and neuronal progenitors. Advanced quantitative analysis identified low-methylated regions (LMRs) with an average methylation of 30{\%}. These represent CpG-poor distal regulatory regions as evidenced by location, DNase I hypersensitivity, presence of enhancer chromatin marks and enhancer activity in reporter assays. LMRs are occupied by DNA-binding factors and their binding is necessary and sufficient to create LMRs. A comparison of neuronal and stem-cell methylomes confirms this dependency, as cell-type-specific LMRs are occupied by cell-type-specific transcription factors. This study provides methylome references for the mouse and shows that DNA-binding factors locally influence DNA methylation, enabling the identification of active regulatory regions.},

abstract = {Mammalian RNA complexity is regulated through interactions of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with their target transcripts. High-throughput sequencing together with UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) is able to globally map RBP-binding footprint regions at the resolution of {\~{}}30–60 nucleotides. Here we describe a systematic way to analyze HITS-CLIP data to identify exact crosslink sites, and thereby determine protein-RNA interactions at single-nucleotide resolution. We found that reverse transcriptase used in CLIP frequently skips the crosslinked amino-acid-RNA adduct, resulting in a nucleotide deletion. Genome-wide analysis of these cross-linking induced mutation sites (CIMS) in Nova and Argonaut (Ago) HITS-CLIP data demonstrated deletions in {\~{}}8–20{\%} mRNA tags, which mapped to Nova and Ago binding sites on mRNA or miRNA in the mouse brain. CIMS analysis provides a general and more precise means of mapping protein-RNA interactions than currently available, as well as providing insight into the biochemical properties of such interactions in living tissues.},

abstract = {Motivation: When running experiments that involve multiple high density
oligonucleotide arrays, it is important to remove sources of variation
between arrays of non-biological origin. Normalization is a process
for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations
between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix
does not perform well in these situations.


Results: We present three methods of performing normalization at the
probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods
because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to
form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two
methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based
algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation
by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two
publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons.
The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform
favorably.


Availability: Software implementing all three of the complete data
normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy,
which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.

One major question is how to cure CML, and the next step for the future will be to address this key issue. CML is a good model of cancer. The fact that the majority of CML patients who respond very well but discontinue tyrosine kinase inhibitors later show evidence of molecular recurrence focuses attention on the need for further research on leukemic stem cells. The challenge now is to understand why, after stopping treatment, the leukemia recurs in some patients but not in others. If we win this battle, this progress will certainly benefit the treatment and management of other leukemias and solid tumors and will validate this new topic.},

abstract = {Many cancers have substantial genomic heterogeneity within a given tumor, and to fully understand that diversity requires the ability to perform single cell analysis. We performed targeted sequencing of a panel of single nucleotide variants (SNVs), deletions, and IgH sequences in 1,479 single tumor cells from six acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. By accurately segregating groups of cooccurring mutations into distinct clonal populations, we identified codominant clones in the majority of patients. Evaluation of intraclonal mutation patterns identified clone-specific punctuated cytosine mutagenesis events, showed that most structural variants are acquired before SNVs, determined that KRAS mutations occur late in disease development but are not sufficient for clonal dominance, and identified clones within the same patient that are arrested at varied stages in B-cell development. Taken together, these data order the sequence of genetic events that underlie childhood ALL and provide a framework for understanding the development of the disease at single-cell resolution.},

Additionally, we developed software tools for the evaluation of individual antibody reagents and antibody panels. Each section describes what has been evaluated experimentally versus adopted based on existing data and experience. Multicentric evaluation demonstrated high levels of reproducibility based on strict implementation of the EuroFlow SOPs and antibody panels. Overall, the 6 years of extensive collaborative experiments and the analysis of hundreds of cell samples of patients and healthy controls in the EuroFlow centers have provided for the first time laboratory protocols and software tools for fully standardized 8-color flow cytometric immunophenotyping of normal and malignant leukocytes in bone marrow and blood; this has yielded highly comparable data sets, which can be integrated in a single database.},

abstract = {Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a prevalent malignancy in Southeast Asia among the Chinese population. Aberrant regulation of transcripts has been implicated in many types of cancers including NPC. Herein, we characterized mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes by RNA sequencing (RNASeq) of NPC model systems. Matched total mRNA and small RNA of undifferentiated Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-positive NPC xenograft X666 and its derived cell line C666, well-differentiated NPC cell line HK1, and the immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line NP460 were sequenced by Solexa technology. We found 2812 genes and 149 miRNAs (human and EBV) to be differentially expressed in NP460, HK1, C666 and X666 with RNASeq; 533 miRNA–mRNA target pairs were inversely regulated in the three NPC cell lines compared to NP460. Integrated mRNA/miRNA expression profiling and pathway analysis show extracellular matrix organization, Beta-1 integrin cell surface interactions, and the PI3K/AKT, EGFR, ErbB, and Wnt pathways were potentially deregulated in NPC. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on selected mRNA/miRNAs in order to validate their expression. Transcript sequence variants such as short insertions and deletions (INDEL), single nucleotide variant (SNV), and isomiRs were characterized in the NPC model systems. A novel TP53 transcript variant was identified in NP460, HK1, and C666. Detection of three previously reported novel EBV-encoded BART miRNAs and their isomiRs were also observed. Meta-analysis of a model system to a clinical system aids the choice of different cell lines in NPC studies. This comprehensive characterization of mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes in NPC cell lines and the xenograft provides insights on miRNA regulation of mRNA and valuable resources on transcript variation and regulation in NPC, which are potentially useful for mechanistic and preclinical studies.},

abstract = {Background.Variability in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression cannot be fully predicted by CD4+ T cell counts or viral load (VL). Because central memory T(TCM)cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of simian immunodeficiency virus disease, we hypothesized that quantifying these cells in early HIV infection could provide prognostic information. Methods.We measured expression of CD45RO, chemokine (C-C motif) receptor (CCR) 5, CCR7, CD27, and CD28 to enumerate naive and memory subsets in samples from recently infected individuals. We also quantified proliferation, CD127 expression, and cell-associated VL. Disease progression was compared across subgroups defined by these measurements, using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression. Results.Four hundred sixty-six subjects contributed 101 events. The proportion or absolute count of TCMcells did not correlate with disease progression, defined as the time to AIDS or death. However, significant associations were observed for proliferation within CD4+ or CD8+ T cells,loss of naive or CD127+ memory CD8+ T cells, and CD4+ T cell-associated VL. Conclusions.Our results demonstrate that the extent of the immunopathogenesis established early in HIV infection predicts the course of future disease. Because antiretroviral drug treatment reverses such defects in part,our study provides mechanistic clues to why early use of antiretrovirals may prove beneficial.},

abstract = {Much-needed attention has been given of late to diseases specifically associated with an expanding elderly population. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a hematopoietic stem cell-based blood disease, is one of these. The lack of clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this disease has hampered the development of efficacious therapies, especially in the presence of co-morbidities. Mouse models could potentially provide new insights into this disease, although primary human MDS cells grow poorly in xenografted mice. This makes genetically-engineered murine models a more attractive proposition, although this approach is not without complications. In particular, it is unclear if or how myelodysplasia (abnormal blood cell morphology), a key MDS feature in humans, presents in murine cells. Here, we evaluate the histopathological features of wild-type mice and 23 mouse models with verified myelodysplasia. We find that certain features indicative of myelodysplasia in humans, such as Howell-Jolly bodies and low neutrophilic granularity, are commonplace in healthy mice, while other features are similarly abnormal in humans and mice. Quantitative hematopoietic parameters, such as blood cell counts, are required to distinguish between MDS and related diseases. We provide data that mouse models of MDS can be genetically engineered and faithfully recapitulate human disease.},

abstract = {The capability of flow cytometry to offer rapid quantification of multidimensional characteristics for millions of cells has made this technology indispensable for health research, medical diagnosis, and treatment. However, the lack of statistical and bioinformatics tools to parallel recent high-throughput technological advancements has hindered this technology from reaching its full potential. We propose a flexible statistical model-based clustering approach for identifying cell populations in flow cytometry data based on t-mixture models with a Box-Cox transformation. This approach generalizes the popular Gaussian mixture models to account for outliers and allow for nonelliptical clusters. We describe an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to simultaneously handle parameter estimation and transformation selection. Using two publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed methodology provides enough flexibility and robustness to mimic manual gating results performed by an expert researcher. In addition, we present results from a simulation study, which show that this new clustering framework gives better results in terms of robustness to model misspecification and estimation of the number of clusters, compared to the popular mixture models. The proposed clustering methodology is well adapted to automated analysis of flow cytometry data. It tends to give more reproducible results, and helps reduce the significant subjectivity and human time cost encountered in manual gating analysis.},

abstract = {Flow Cytometry has become a mainstay technique for measuring fluorescent
and physical attributes of single cells in a suspended mixture. These
data are reduced during analysis using a manual or semiautomated
process of gating. Despite the need to gate data for traditional
analyses, it is well recognized that analyst-to-analyst variability
can impact the dataset. Moreover, cells of interest can be inadvertently
excluded from the gate, and relationships between collected variables
may go unappreciated because they were not included in the original
analysis plan. A multivariate non-gating technique was developed
and implemented that accomplished the same goal as traditional gating
while eliminating many weaknesses. The procedure was validated against
traditional gating for analysis of circulating B cells in normal
donors (n = 20) and persons with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (n
= 42). The method recapitulated relationships in the dataset while
providing for an automated and objective assessment of the data.
Flow cytometry analyses are amenable to automated analytical techniques
that are not predicated on discrete operator-generated gates. Such
alternative approaches can remove subjectivity in data analysis,
improve efficiency and may ultimately enable construction of large
bioinformatics data systems for more sophisticated approaches to
hypothesis testing.},

Mutational and epigenetic profiling of a large acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient cohort revealed that IDH1/2-mutant AMLs display global DNA hypermethylation and a specific hypermethylation signature. Furthermore, expression of 2HG-producing IDH alleles in cells induced global DNA hypermethylation. In the AML cohort, IDH1/2 mutations were mutually exclusive with mutations in the $\alpha$-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme TET2, and TET2 loss-of-function mutations were associated with similar epigenetic defects as IDH1/2 mutants. Consistent with these genetic and epigenetic data, expression of IDH mutants impaired TET2 catalytic function in cells. Finally, either expression of mutant IDH1/2 or Tet2 depletion impaired hematopoietic differentiation and increased stem/progenitor cell marker expression, suggesting a shared proleukemogenic effect.},

Input are eight list mode data files acquired with a FACScan flow
cytometer. For each cell, four parameters are measured: forward light
scatter, orthogonal light scatter, fluorescein fluorescence, and
phycoerythrin fluorescence. Eight data files are acquired in the
following sequence: unstained, isotype controls, CD10/CD19, CD20/CD5,
CD3/CD22, CD7/CD33, HLADR/CD13, and CD34/CD38. First, each of the
data files 3 to 8 are clustered independently employing an algorithm
based on nearest neighbors. Next, the clusters are associated across
the data files to form cell populations, using the assumption of
light scatter invariance across tubes for each population. The mean
positions of each cell population are fed into a decision tree. The
decision tree first identifies normal cell populations, i.e., monocytes,
neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, NK cells, T-lymphocytes, and
B-lymphocytes. After elimination of the normal cell populations from
the data space, the residual cell populations are classified as B-lineage
ALL, T-lineage ALL, AML, AUL, B-CLL, or unknown. The effectiveness
of this novel approach is shown with case studies of B-lymphoid,
T-lymphoid, and Myeloid acute leukemias.},

abstract = {Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a prevalent malignancy in Southeast Asia among the Chinese population. Aberrant regulation of transcripts has been implicated in many types of cancers including NPC. Herein, we characterized mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes by RNA sequencing (RNASeq) of NPC model systems. Matched total mRNA and small RNA of undifferentiated Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-positive NPC xenograft X666 and its derived cell line C666, well-differentiated NPC cell line HK1, and the immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line NP460 were sequenced by Solexa technology. We found 2812 genes and 149 miRNAs (human and EBV) to be differentially expressed in NP460, HK1, C666 and X666 with RNASeq; 533 miRNA–mRNA target pairs were inversely regulated in the three NPC cell lines compared to NP460. Integrated mRNA/miRNA expression profiling and pathway analysis show extracellular matrix organization, Beta-1 integrin cell surface interactions, and the PI3K/AKT, EGFR, ErbB, and Wnt pathways were potentially deregulated in NPC. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on selected mRNA/miRNAs in order to validate their expression. Transcript sequence variants such as short insertions and deletions (INDEL), single nucleotide variant (SNV), and isomiRs were characterized in the NPC model systems. A novel TP53 transcript variant was identified in NP460, HK1, and C666. Detection of three previously reported novel EBV-encoded BART miRNAs and their isomiRs were also observed. Meta-analysis of a model system to a clinical system aids the choice of different cell lines in NPC studies. This comprehensive characterization of mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes in NPC cell lines and the xenograft provides insights on miRNA regulation of mRNA and valuable resources on transcript variation and regulation in NPC, which are potentially useful for mechanistic and preclinical studies.},

abstract = {The DNA methylation inhibitor azacitidine (5-azacytidine) is used against myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, but drug resistance is an ongoing, intractable problem. To investigate resistance mechanisms, we generated two azacitidine-resistant cell lines, THP-1/AR and HL60/AR, and studied genetic disparities between them and their corresponding parental lines. In cells treated with azacitidine, significant mitotic variations were noted in parental cells which were absent in resistant cells, suggesting that resistance arises from negating azacitidine-mediated activation of apoptosis signaling and reestablishing G2/M checkpoint. Importantly, both resistant cell lines have common point mutations in the uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2) gene, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of the azacitidine activation pathway. Forced expression of mutated UCK2 in parental THP-1 cells abrogated azacitidine-induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of wild type UCK2 in resistant THP-1/AR cells restored sensitivity to azacitidine, implying that UCK2 gene mutations perturb azacitidine activation and advance azacitidine resistance. Our study provides new insights into azacitidine resistance and establishes models useful in developing effective strategies to overcome it.},

US regulatory approval of azacitidine, decitabine, and lenalidomide between 2004 and 2006 seemed to herald a new era in the development of disease-modifying therapies for MDS, but there have been no further drug approvals for MDS indications in the United States in the last 8 years. The available drugs are not curative, and few of the compounds that are currently in development are likely to be approved in the near future. As a result, MDS diagnoses continue to place a heavy burden on both patients and health care systems. Incomplete understanding of disease pathology, the inherent biological complexity of MDS, and the presence of comorbid conditions and poor performance status in the typical older patient with MDS have been major impediments to development of effective novel therapies. Here we discuss new insights from genomic discoveries that are illuminating MDS pathogenesis, increasing diagnostic accuracy, and refining prognostic assessment, and which will one day contribute to more effective treatments and improved patient outcomes.},

abstract = {For cancer patients, the current approach to prognosis relies on clinicopathological staging, but usually this provides little information about the individual response to treatment. Therefore, there is a tremendous need for protein and genetic biomarkers with predictive and prognostic information. As biomarkers are identified, the serial monitoring of tumor genotypes, which are instable and prone to changes under selection pressure, is becoming increasingly possible. To this end, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) shed from primary and metastatic cancers may allow the non-invasive analysis of the evolution of tumor genomes during treatment and disease progression through 'liquid biopsies'. Here we review recent progress in the identification of CTCs among thousands of other cells in the blood and new high-resolution approaches, including recent microfluidic platforms, for dissecting the genomes of CTCs and obtaining functional data. We also discuss new ctDNA-based approaches, which may become a powerful alternative to CTC analysis. Together, these approaches provide novel biological insights into the process of metastasis and may elucidate signaling pathways involved in cell invasiveness and metastatic competence. In medicine these liquid biopsies may emerge to be powerful predictive and prognostic biomarkers and could therefore be instrumental for areas such as precision or personalized medicine.

Modern high-throughput technologies enable deep sequencing of such RNA species on an unprecedented scale. We find that the analysis of small RNA deep-sequencing libraries can be affected by cross-mapping, in which RNA sequences originating from one locus are inadvertently mapped to another. Similar to cross-hybridization on microarrays, cross-mapping is prevalent among miRNAs, as they tend to occur in families, are similar or derived from repeat or structural RNAs, or are post-transcriptionally modified. Here, we develop a strategy to correct for cross-mapping, and apply it to the analysis of RNA editing in mature miRNAs. In contrast to previous reports, our analysis suggests that RNA editing in mature miRNAs is rare in animals.},

abstract = {Motivation: Clustering microarray gene expression data is a powerful tool for elucidating co-regulatory relationships among genes. Many different clustering techniques have been successfully applied and the results are promising. However, substantial fluctuation contained in microarray data, lack of knowledge on the number of clusters and complex regulatory mechanisms underlying biological systems make the clustering problems tremendously challenging.
Results: We devised an improved model-based Bayesian approach to cluster microarray gene expression data. Cluster assignment is carried out by an iterative weighted Chinese restaurant seating scheme such that the optimal number of clusters can be determined simultaneously with cluster assignment. The predictive updating technique was applied to improve the efficiency of the Gibbs sampler. An additional step is added during reassignment to allow genes that display complex correlation relationships such as time-shifted and/or inverted to be clustered together. Analysis done on a real dataset showed that as much as 30{\%} of significant genes clustered in the same group display complex relationships with the consensus pattern of the cluster. Other notable features including automatic handling of missing data, quantitative measures of cluster strength and assignment confidence. Synthetic and real microarray gene expression datasets were analyzed to demonstrate its performance.
Availability: A computer program named Chinese restaurant cluster (CRC) has been developed based on this algorithm. The program can be downloaded at http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/qin/CRC/

In tumours, where genetic heterogeneity is common, very important information may be lost that would be useful for reconstructing evolutionary history. Here we show that with flow-sorted nuclei, whole genome amplification and next generation sequencing we can accurately quantify genomic copy number within an individual nucleus. We apply single-nucleus sequencing to investigate tumour population structure and evolution in two human breast cancer cases. Analysis of 100 single cells from a polygenomic tumour revealed three distinct clonal subpopulations that probably represent sequential clonal expansions. Additional analysis of 100 single cells from a monogenomic primary tumour and its liver metastasis indicated that a single clonal expansion formed the primary tumour and seeded the metastasis. In both primary tumours, we also identified an unexpectedly abundant subpopulation of genetically diverse ‘pseudodiploid' cells that do not travel to the metastatic site. In contrast to gradual models of tumour progression, our data indicate that tumours grow by punctuated clonal expansions with few persistent intermediates.},

abstract = {This protocol details a method for measuring the DNA methylation state of multiple target sites in single cells, otherwise known as single-cell restriction analysis of methylation (SCRAM). The basic steps include isolating and lysing single cells, digesting genomic DNA with a methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease (MSRE) and amplification of multiple targets by two rounds of PCR to determine the methylation status of target sites. The method can reliably and accurately detect the methylation status of multiple target sites in each single cell, and it can be completed in a relatively short time ({\textless}2 d) at low cost. Consequently, the method may be preferable over whole-genome methods in applications requiring highly reliable and cost-effective coverage of specific target sites in all cells from a sample and in cases when the DNA methylation states of single CpG sites are representative of the methylation status of corresponding regions of interest.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, alternative cleavage of 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) can affect transcript stability, transport and translation. For polyadenylated (poly(A)) transcripts, cleavage sites can be characterized with short-read sequencing using specialized library construction methods. However, for large-scale cohort studies as well as for clinical sequencing applications, it is desirable to characterize such events using RNA-seq data, as the latter are already widely applied to identify other relevant information, such as mutations, alternative splicing and chimeric transcripts. Here we describe KLEAT, an analysis tool that uses de novo assembly of RNA-seq data to characterize cleavage sites on 3' UTRs. We demonstrate the performance of KLEAT on three cell line RNA-seq libraries constructed and sequenced by the ENCODE project, and assembled using Trans-ABySS. Validating the KLEAT predictions with matched ENCODE RNA-seq and RNA-PET libraries, we show that the tool has over 90{\%} positive predictive value when there are at least three RNA-seq reads supporting a poly(A) tail and requiring at least three RNA-PET reads mapping within 100 nucleotides as validation. We also compare the performance of KLEAT with other popular RNA-seq analysis pipelines that reconstruct 3' UTR ends, and show that it performs favourably, based on an ROC-like curve.},

In low- to intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), we establish the existence of rare multipotent MDS stem cells (MDS-SCs), and their hierarchical relationship to lineage-restricted MDS progenitors. All identified somatically acquired genetic lesions were backtracked to distinct MDS-SCs, establishing their distinct MDS-propagating function invivo. In isolated del(5q)-MDS, acquisition of del(5q) preceded diverse recurrent driver mutations. Sequential analysis in del(5q)-MDS revealed genetic evolution in MDS-SCs and MDS-progenitors prior to leukemic transformation. These findings provide definitive evidence for rare human MDS-SCs invivo, with extensive implications for the targeting of the cells required and sufficient for MDS-propagation. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: CD56 antigen expression has been reported in several hematologic malignancies. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML)M2 with t(8;21) and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) it has been found to be consistently associated with an unfavorable prognosis, whereas in other AML subtypes its role remains uncertain. We investigated CD56 expression in a cohort of AML patients in order to assess its frequency and prognostic relevance.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Immunophenotypic analysis including that of CD56 antigen was available for 171 consecutive AML patients (139 with AML and 32 with APL), enrolled between December 1995 and December 1999 at a single institution. A sample of fresh bone marrow cells taken at diagnosis was recorded as positive when at least 20{\%} of the cells double-stained with specific monoclonal antibodies against CD56 and CD33 antigens.
RESULTS: CD56 positivity was demonstrated in 37 cases (21.6{\%}). Its frequency was lower in M4 (6{\%}) and higher in M5 (37{\%}). The median percentage for CD56+ blasts was 56{\%} (range 21-99{\%}). CD56 positivity did not correlate with age, sex, blast count, favorable or unfavorable cytogenetics at diagnosis, nor did it influence the outcome in terms of complete remission (CR) duration (606 vs. 417 days, p=n.s.) or overall survival (OS) (210 vs. 277 days, p= n.s.). In the APL subgroup a significant difference in relapse rate was found at 3 years (71.4{\%} in the CD56 positive group vs. 12{\%} in the CD56 negative group, p=0.005).
INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that CD56 positivity in APL patients at diagnosis is associated with a worse prognosis, suggesting that close molecular monitoring is necessary in CD56 positive APL patients. In contrast, the prognostic role of CD56 remains uncertain in the other AML subtypes.},

abstract = {BackgroundTo improve cancer therapy, it is critical to target metastasizing cells. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are rare cells found in the blood of patients with solid tumors and may play a key role in cancer dissemination. Uncovering CTC phenotypes offers a potential avenue to inform treatment. However, CTC transcriptional profiling is limited by leukocyte contamination; an approach to surmount this problem is single cell analysis. Here we demonstrate feasibility of performing high dimensional single CTC profiling, providing early insight into CTC heterogeneity and allowing comparisons to breast cancer cell lines widely used for drug discovery.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe purified CTCs using the MagSweeper, an immunomagnetic enrichment device that isolates live tumor cells from unfractionated blood. CTCs that met stringent criteria for further analysis were obtained from 70{\%} (14/20) of primary and 70{\%} (21/30) of metastatic breast cancer patients; none were captured from patients with non-epithelial cancer (n = 20) or healthy subjects (n = 25). Microfluidic-based single cell transcriptional profiling of 87 cancer-associated and reference genes showed heterogeneity among individual CTCs, separating them into two major subgroups, based on 31 highly expressed genes. In contrast, single cells from seven breast cancer cell lines were tightly clustered together by sample ID and ER status. CTC profiles were distinct from those of cancer cell lines, questioning the suitability of such lines for drug discovery efforts for late stage cancer therapy.Conclusions/SignificanceFor the first time, we directly measured high dimensional gene expression in individual CTCs without the common practice of pooling such cells. Elevated transcript levels of genes associated with metastasis NPTN, S100A4, S100A9, and with epithelial mesenchymal transition: VIM, TGF{\ss}1, ZEB2, FOXC1, CXCR4, were striking compared to cell lines. Our findings demonstrate that profiling CTCs on a cell-by-cell basis is possible and may facilitate the application of ‘liquid biopsies' to better model drug discovery.},

To find novel prognostic markers, we analyzed flow cytometric data from 229 diagnostic DLBCL samples using an automated multiparameter data analysis approach developed in our laboratory. By using the developed automated data analysis pipeline, we identified 71 of 229 cases as having more than 35{\%} B cells with a high side scatter (SSC) profile, a parameter reflecting internal cellular complexity. This high SSC B-cell feature was associated with inferior overall and progression-free survival (P = .001 and P = .01, respectively) and remained a significant predictor of overall survival in multivariate Cox regression analysis (IPI, P = .001; high SSC, P = .004; rituximab, P = .53)., This study suggests that high SSC among B cells may serve as a useful biomarker to identify patients with DLBCL at high risk for relapse. This is of particular interest because this biomarker is readily available in most clinical laboratories without significant alteration to existing routine diagnostic strategies or incurring additional costs.},

abstract = {With high-dimensional data, variable-by-variable statistical testing is often used to select variables whose behavior differs across conditions. Such an approach requires adjustment for multiple testing, which can result in low statistical power. A two-stage approach that first filters variables by a criterion independent of the test statistic, and then only tests variables which pass the filter, can provide higher power. We show that use of some filter/test statistics pairs presented in the literature may, however, lead to loss of type I error control. We describe other pairs which avoid this problem. In an application to microarray data, we found that gene-by-gene filtering by overall variance followed by a t-test increased the number of discoveries by 50{\%}. We also show that this particular statistic pair induces a lower bound on fold-change among the set of discoveries. Independent filtering—using filter/test pairs that are independent under the null hypothesis but correlated under the alternative—is a general approach that can substantially increase the efficiency of experiments.},

abstract = {Motivation: Clustering microarray gene expression data is a powerful tool for elucidating co-regulatory relationships among genes. Many different clustering techniques have been successfully applied and the results are promising. However, substantial fluctuation contained in microarray data, lack of knowledge on the number of clusters and complex regulatory mechanisms underlying biological systems make the clustering problems tremendously challenging.
Results: We devised an improved model-based Bayesian approach to cluster microarray gene expression data. Cluster assignment is carried out by an iterative weighted Chinese restaurant seating scheme such that the optimal number of clusters can be determined simultaneously with cluster assignment. The predictive updating technique was applied to improve the efficiency of the Gibbs sampler. An additional step is added during reassignment to allow genes that display complex correlation relationships such as time-shifted and/or inverted to be clustered together. Analysis done on a real dataset showed that as much as 30{\%} of significant genes clustered in the same group display complex relationships with the consensus pattern of the cluster. Other notable features including automatic handling of missing data, quantitative measures of cluster strength and assignment confidence. Synthetic and real microarray gene expression datasets were analyzed to demonstrate its performance.
Availability: A computer program named Chinese restaurant cluster (CRC) has been developed based on this algorithm. The program can be downloaded at http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/qin/CRC/

A recent study has shown that major sources of variation are masked when gene expression is averaged over many cells. Heritable variations that determine single-cell expression phenotypes may exert a regulatory function in specific cellular processes underlying disease. Masked effects on gene expression should therefore be modeled, not ignored.

@article{Gentleman2005,
abstract = {While scientific research and the methodologies involved have gone through substantial technological evolution the technology involved in the publication of the results of these endeavors has remained relatively stagnant. Publication is largely done in the same manner today as it was fifty years ago. Many journals have adopted electronic formats, however, their orientation and style is little different from a printed document. The documents tend to be static and take little advantage of computational resources that might be available. Recent work, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003), suggests a methodology and basic infrastructure that can be used to publish documents in a substantially different way. Their approach is suitable for the publication of papers whose message relies on computation. Stated quite simply, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003) propose a paradigm where documents are mixtures of code and text. Such documents may be self-contained or they may be a component of a compendium which provides the infrastructure needed to provide access to data and supporting software. These documents, or compendiums, can be processed in a number of different ways. One transformation will be to replace the code with its output -- thereby providing the familiar, but limited, static document. {\textless}p /{\textgreater} In this paper we apply these concepts to a seminal paper in bioinformatics, namely The Molecular Classification of Cancer, Golub et al (1999). The authors of that paper have generously provided data and other information that have allowed us to largely reproduce their results. Rather than reproduce this paper exactly we demonstrate that such a reproduction is possible and instead concentrate on demonstrating the usefulness of the compendium concept itself.},

@article{Chowdhury2013a,
abstract = {Motivation: Development and progression of solid tumors can be attributed to a process of mutations, which typically includes changes in the number of copies of genes or genomic regions. Although comparisons of cells within single tumors show extensive heterogeneity, recurring features of their evolutionary process may be discerned by comparing multiple regions or cells of a tumor. A useful source of data for studying likely progression of individual tumors is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which allows one to count copy numbers of several genes in hundreds of single cells. Novel algorithms for interpreting such data phylogenetically are needed, however, to reconstruct likely evolutionary trajectories from states of single cells and facilitate analysis of tumor evolution.
Results: In this article, we develop phylogenetic methods to infer likely models of tumor progression using FISH copy number data and apply them to a study of FISH data from two cancer types. Statistical analyses of topological characteristics of the tree-based model provide insights into likely tumor progression pathways consistent with the prior literature. Furthermore, tree statistics from the resulting phylogenies can be used as features for prediction methods. This results in improved accuracy, relative to unstructured gene copy number data, at predicting tumor state and future metastasis.

This chapter presents the Melting Point (MP), a proposed new methodology for developing ontologies within decentralised settings. It describes how MP was developed by taking best practices from other methodologies, provides details on recommended steps and recommended processes, and compares MP with alternatives. The methodology presented here is the product of direct first-hand experience and observation of biological communities of practice in which some of the authors have been involved. The Melting Point is a methodology engineered for decentralised communities of practice for which the designers of technology and the users may be the same group. As such, MP provides a potential foundation for the establishment of standard practices for ontology engineering.},

@article{Zare2012a,
abstract = {Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) exhibit similar but distinct immunophenotypic profiles. Many cases can be diagnosed readily by flow cytometry (FCM) alone; however, ambiguous cases are frequently encountered and necessitate additional studies, including immunohistochemical staining for cyclin D1 and fluorescence in situ hybridization for IgH-CCND1 rearrangement. To determine if greater diagnostic accuracy could be achieved from FCM data alone, we developed an unbiased, machine-based algorithm to identify features that best distinguish between the 2 diseases. By applying conventional diagnostic criteria to the flow cytometry data, we were able to assign 28 of 44 (64{\%}) MCL and 48 of 70 (69{\%}) SLL cases correctly. In contrast, we were able to assign all 44 (100{\%}) MCL and 68 of 70 (97{\%}) SLL cases correctly using a novel set of criteria, as identified by our automated approach. The most discriminating feature was the CD20/CD23 mean fluorescence intensity ratio, and we found unexpectedly that inclusion of FMC7 expression in the diagnostic algorithm actually reduced its accuracy. This study demonstrates that computational methods can be used on existing clinical FCM data to improve diagnostic accuracy and suggests similar computational approaches could be used to identify novel prognostic markers and perhaps subdivide existing or define new diagnostic entities.},

abstract = {The deep-sequencing of small RNAs has revealed that different numbers and proportions of miRNA variants called isomiRs are formed from single miRNA genes and that this effect is attributable mainly to imprecise cleavage by Drosha and Dicer. Factors that influence the degree of cleavage precision of Drosha and Dicer are under investigation, and their identification may improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which cells modulate the regulatory potential of miRNAs. In this study, we focused on the sequences and structural determinants of Drosha and Dicer cleavage sites, which may explain the generation of homogeneous miRNAs (in which a single isomiR strongly predominates) as well as the generation of heterogeneous miRNAs. Using deep-sequencing data for small RNAs, we demonstrate that the generation of homogeneous miRNAs requires more sequence constraints at the cleavage sites than the formation of heterogeneous miRNAs. Additionally, our results indicate that specific Drosha cleavage sites have more sequence determinants in miRNA precursors than specific cleavage sites for Dicer and that secondary structural motifs in the miRNA precursors influence the precision of Dicer cleavage. Together, we present the sequence and structural features of Drosha and Dicer cleavage sites that influence the heterogeneity of the released miRNAs.},

abstract = {Previous results from two proficiency panels of intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) from the Cancer Immunotherapy Consortium and panels from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and the Association for Cancer Immunotherapy highlight the variability across laboratories in reported {\%} CD8+ or {\%} CD4+ cytokine-positive cells. One of the main causes of interassay variability in flow cytometry-based assays is due to differences in gating strategies between laboratories, which may prohibit the generation of robust results within single centers and across institutions. To study how gating strategies affect the variation in reported results, a gating panel was organized where all participants analyzed the same set of Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) files from a four-color ICS assay using their own gating protocol (Phase I) and a gating protocol drafted by consensus from the organizers of the panel (Phase II). Focusing on analysis removed donor, assay, and instrument variation, enabling us to quantify the variability caused by gating alone. One hundred ten participating laboratories applied 110 different gating approaches. This led to high variability in the reported percentage of cytokine-positive cells and consequently in response detection in Phase I. However, variability was dramatically reduced when all laboratories used the same gating strategy (Phase II). Proximity of the cytokine gate to the negative population most impacted true-positive and false-positive response detection. Recommendations are provided for the (1) placement of the cytokine-positive gate, (2) identification of CD4+ CD8+ double-positive T cells, (3) placement of lymphocyte gate, (4) inclusion of dim cells, (5) gate uniformity, and 6) proper adjustment of the biexponential scaling. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

abstract = {Imatinib mesylate (IM) and other ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have had a major impact on early phase CML patient outcomes. However, they are rarely curative and initial and acquired TKI resistance remain challenges. This is attributed to the finding that chronic phase CML stem cells are innately more resistant to IM and other TKIs than the bulk of the more mature cells they generate. To identify differentially expressed and new miRNAs in CD34+ CML stem/progenitor cells that could be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, we used Illumina Deep Sequencing to obtain absolute miRNA expression profiles of highly purified CD34+ cells obtained at diagnosis from three CML patients who were classified retrospectively, after IM therapy, as IM-responders and three as IM-nonresponders. CD34+ cells isolated from five normal bone marrow (NBM) samples were similarly analyzed as controls. Bioconductor DESeq analysis revealed 63 differentially expressed miRNAs in the CD34+ cells from CML and NBM samples (P{\textless}0.05). Interestingly, 12 of these were differentially expressed in CD34+ cells from the IM-responders and nonresponders. Most of the 63 differentially expressed miRNAs identified were present at reduced levels in the CD34+ CML cells as compared to NBM, but 17 were increased. In addition, 34 novel miRNAs were identified in the CD34+ CML stem/progenitor cells. We next validated sequencing data in CD34+ cells from IM-responders (n=12), IM-nonresponders (n=10) and normal individuals (n=11) using a high-throughput quantitative microfluidic device. These studies confirmed the differential expression in CD34+ CML cells of 32 of the 63 identified miRNAs (P{\textless}0.05), including an increased level of oncomirs miR-155 and miR-17-92, and a decreased level of the tumor suppressors, miR-145, miR-151, and miR-452. Importantly, we detected significant changes in some of these miRNAs in CD34+ cells from CML patients after three months of nilotinib (NL) treatment (23 normalized after three months of NL treatment, whereas 10 showed little change). To further correlate miRNA profiles with corresponding mRNA expression changes, and to identify potential target genes, RNA-seq was performed on the same RNA samples. Bioconductor RmiR analysis was performed to match miRNA target genes whose expression was inversely correlated with the expression of the deregulated miRNAs based on three of six prediction algorithms (mirBase, TargetScan, miRanda, tarBase, mirTarget2, and PicTar). We identified 1,210 differentially expressed mRNAs that are predicted targets of the deregulated miRNAs in the comparison of CML and NBM data. Strikingly, only seven differentially expressed mRNAs were predicted targets of the deregulated miRNAs identified from a comparison of the IM-responders and nonresponders. Most of these are predicted to have roles in regulation of the cell cycle, MAPK signaling and TGF-beta signaling pathways by DAVID Bioinformatics Resources, which clusters predicted target genes to known KEGG pathways. Thus, aberrant, differentially expressed miRNAs and target genes identified in primitive CML stem/progenitor cells may serve as useful biomarkers to predict clinical response of CML patients to TKI therapy, and may ultimately lead to identification of potential therapeutic targets for improved treatment of CML patients.

abstract = {Once thought to be rare disorders, the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are now recognized as among the most common hematological neoplasms, probably affecting {\textgreater}30 000 patients per year in the United States. US regulatory approval of azacitidine, decitabine, and lenalidomide between 2004 and 2006 seemed to herald a new era in the development of disease-modifying therapies for MDS, but there have been no further drug approvals for MDS indications in the United States in the last 8 years. The available drugs are not curative, and few of the compounds that are currently in development are likely to be approved in the near future. As a result, MDS diagnoses continue to place a heavy burden on both patients and health care systems. Incomplete understanding of disease pathology, the inherent biological complexity of MDS, and the presence of comorbid conditions and poor performance status in the typical older patient with MDS have been major impediments to development of effective novel therapies. Here we discuss new insights from genomic discoveries that are illuminating MDS pathogenesis, increasing diagnostic accuracy, and refining prognostic assessment, and which will one day contribute to more effective treatments and improved patient outcomes.},

abstract = {Azacitidine (AZA) is the current treatment for patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, but resistance is a common feature of AZA-treated patients. To investigate the mechanisms associated with AZA resistance in vitro, we generated AZA-resistant SKM1 myeloid cells, called hereafter AZA-R. AZA-R cells exhibit impaired mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and caspase activation in response to AZA compared to their AZA-sensitive (AZA-S) counterpart. AZA induced LC3-II accumulation and cathepsin B activity in AZA-S cells, two hallmarks of autophagy. AZA-R cells displayed increased basal autophagy but are resistant to AZA-mediated autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy using LC3 siRNA revealed that autophagy is protective in AZA-S cells and AZA-R cells in basal conditions. By contrast, AZA-R cells exhibited impaired autophagy in response to AZA. Collectively, our findings indicate that AZA promotes apoptosis and autophagy in SKM1 cells, and that AZA-R cells are resistant to both apoptosis and autophagy induced by AZA.},

Since then, there have been numerous advances in the identification of unique biomarkers associated with some myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias, largely derived from gene expression analysis and next-generation sequencing that can significantly improve the diagnostic criteria as well as the prognostic relevance of entities currently included in the WHO classification and that also suggest new entities that should be added. Therefore, there is a clear need for a revision to the current classification. The revisions to the categories of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia will be published in a monograph in 2016 and reflect a consensus of opinion of hematopathologists, hematologists, oncologists, and geneticists. The 2016 edition represents a revision of the prior classification rather than an entirely new classification and attempts to incorporate new clinical, prognostic, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic data that have emerged since the last edition. The major changes in the classification and their rationale are presented here.},

abstract = {Most patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) die from progressive disease after relapse, which is associated with clonal evolution at the cytogenetic level. To determine the mutational spectrum associated with relapse, we sequenced the primary tumour and relapse genomes from eight AML patients, and validated hundreds of somatic mutations using deep sequencing; this allowed us to define clonality and clonal evolution patterns precisely at relapse. In addition to discovering novel, recurrently mutated genes (for example, WAC, SMC3, DIS3, DDX41 and DAXX) in AML, we also found two major clonal evolution patterns during AML relapse: (1) the founding clone in the primary tumour gained mutations and evolved into the relapse clone, or (2) a subclone of the founding clone survived initial therapy, gained additional mutations and expanded at relapse. In all cases, chemotherapy failed to eradicate the founding clone. The comparison of relapse-specific versus primary tumour mutations in all eight cases revealed an increase in transversions, probably due to DNA damage caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy. These data demonstrate that AML relapse is associated with the addition of new mutations and clonal evolution, which is shaped, in part, by the chemotherapy that the patients receive to establish and maintain remissions.},

abstract = {The accurate identification of rare antigen-specific cytokine positive cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after antigenic stimulation in an intracellular staining (ICS) flow cytometry assay is challenging, as cytokine positive events may be fairly diffusely distributed and lack an obvious separation from the negative population. Traditionally, the approach by flow operators has been to manually set a positivity threshold to partition events into cytokine-positive and cytokine-negative. This approach suffers from subjectivity and inconsistency across different flow operators. The use of statistical clustering methods does not remove the need to find an objective threshold between positive and negative events since consistent identification of rare event subsets is highly challenging for automated algorithms, especially when there is distributional overlap between the positive and negative events (“smear”). We present a new approach, based on the F$\beta$ measure, which is similar to manual thresholding in providing a hard cutoff, but has the advantage of being determined objectively. We first show that visually determined thresholds are difficult to reproduce and pose a problem when comparing results across operators or laboratories, as well as problems that occur with the use of commonly employed clustering algorithms. In contrast, a single parameterization for the F$\beta$ method performs consistently across different centers, samples, and instruments because it optimizes the precision/recall tradeoff by using both negative and positive controls. The performance of this algorithm is compared with results obtained by expert visual gating. Several ICS data sets from the External Quality Assurance Program Oversight Laboratory (EQAPOL) proficiency program were used to make the comparisons.},

Modern high-throughput technologies enable deep sequencing of such RNA species on an unprecedented scale. We find that the analysis of small RNA deep-sequencing libraries can be affected by cross-mapping, in which RNA sequences originating from one locus are inadvertently mapped to another. Similar to cross-hybridization on microarrays, cross-mapping is prevalent among miRNAs, as they tend to occur in families, are similar or derived from repeat or structural RNAs, or are post-transcriptionally modified. Here, we develop a strategy to correct for cross-mapping, and apply it to the analysis of RNA editing in mature miRNAs. In contrast to previous reports, our analysis suggests that RNA editing in mature miRNAs is rare in animals.},

abstract = {Analysis of high-dimensional flow cytometry datasets can reveal novel cell populations with poorly understood biology. Following discovery, characterization of these populations in terms of the critical markers involved is an important step, as this can help to both better understand the biology of these populations and aid in designing simpler marker panels to identify them on simpler instruments and with fewer reagents (i.e., in resource poor or highly regulated clinical settings). However, current tools to design panels based on the biological characteristics of the target cell populations work exclusively based on technical parameters (e.g., instrument configurations, spectral overlap, and reagent availability). To address this shortcoming, we developed RchyOptimyx (cellular hieraRCHY OPTIMization), a computational tool that constructs cellular hierarchies by combining automated gating with dynamic programming and graph theory to provide the best gating strategies to identify a target population to a desired level of purity or correlation with a clinical outcome, using the simplest possible marker panels. RchyOptimyx can assess and graphically present the trade-offs between marker choice and population specificity in high-dimensional flow or mass cytometry datasets. We present three proof-of-concept use cases for RchyOptimyx that involve 1) designing a panel of surface markers for identification of rare populations that are primarily characterized using their intracellular signature; 2) simplifying the gating strategy for identification of a target cell population; 3) identification of a non-redundant marker set to identify a target cell population. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

Key to further elucidation of their roles is the generation of more complete lists of their numbers and expression changes in different cell states. Here, we report a new method for surveying the expression of small RNAs, including microRNAs, using Illumina sequencing technology. We also present a set of methods for annotating sequences deriving from known miRNAs, identifying variability in mature miRNA sequences, and identifying sequences belonging to previously unidentified miRNA genes. Application of this approach to RNA from human embryonic stem cells obtained before and after their differentiation into embryoid bodies revealed the sequences and expression levels of 334 known plus 104 novel miRNA genes. One hundred seventy-one known and 23 novel microRNA sequences exhibited significant expression differences between these two developmental states. Owing to the increased number of sequence reads, these libraries represent the deepest miRNA sampling to date, spanning nearly six orders of magnitude of expression. The predicted targets of those miRNAs enriched in either sample shared common features. Included among the high-ranked predicted gene targets are those implicated in differentiation, cell cycle control, programmed cell death, and transcriptional regulation.},

We applied multiregion exome sequencing (M-seq) to resolve the genetic architecture and evolutionary histories of ten ccRCCs. Ultra-deep sequencing identified ITH in all cases. We found that 73-75{\%} of identified ccRCC driver aberrations were subclonal, confounding estimates of driver mutation prevalence. ITH increased with the number of biopsies analyzed, without evidence of saturation in most tumors. Chromosome 3p loss and VHL aberrations were the only ubiquitous events. The proportion of C{\textgreater}T transitions at CpG sites increased during tumor progression. M-seq permits the temporal resolution of ccRCC evolution and refines mutational signatures occurring during tumor development.},

abstract = {Pediatric cancer is a relatively rare and heterogeneous group of hematological and non-hematological malignancies which require multiple procedures for its diagnostic screening and classification. Until now, flow cytometry (FC) has not been systematically applied to the diagnostic work-up of such malignancies, particularly for solid tumors. Here we evaluated a FC panel of markers for the diagnostic screening of pediatric cancer and further classification of pediatric solid tumors. The proposed strategy aims at the differential diagnosis between tumoral vs. reactive samples, and hematological vs. non-hematological malignancies, and the subclassification of solid tumors. In total, 52 samples from 40 patients suspicious of containing tumor cells were analyzed by FC in parallel to conventional diagnostic procedures. The overall concordance rate between both approaches was of 96{\%} (50/52 diagnostic samples), with 100{\%} agreement for all reactive/inflammatory and non-infiltrated samples as well as for those corresponding to solid tumors (n = 35), with only two false negative cases diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma and anaplastic lymphoma, respectively. Moreover, clear discrimination between samples infiltrated by hematopoietic vs. non-hematopoietic tumor cells was systematically achieved. Distinct subtypes of solid tumors showed different protein expression profiles, allowing for the differential diagnosis of neuroblastoma (CD56hi/GD2+/CD81hi), primitive neuroectodermal tumors (CD271hi/CD99+), Wilms tumors ({\textgreater}1 cell population), rhabdomyosarcoma (nuMYOD1+/numyogenin+), carcinomas (CD45−/EpCAM+), germ cell tumors (CD56+/CD45−/NG2+/CD10+) and eventually also hemangiopericytomas (CD45−/CD34+). In summary, our results show that multiparameter FC provides fast and useful complementary data to routine histopathology for the diagnostic screening and classification of pediatric cancer.},

abstract = {Modification of microRNA sequences by the 3' addition of nucleotides to generate so-called "isomiRs" adds to the complexity of miRNA function, with recent reports showing that 3' modifications can influence miRNA stability and efficiency of target repression. Here, we show that the 3' modification of miRNAs is a physiological and common post-transcriptional event that shows selectivity for specific miRNAs and is observed across species ranging from C. elegans to human. The modifications result predominantly from adenylation and uridylation and are seen across tissue types, disease states, and developmental stages. To quantitatively profile 3' nucleotide additions, we developed and validated a novel assay based on NanoString Technologies' nCounter platform. For certain miRNAs, the frequency of modification was altered by processes such as cell differentiation, indicating that 3' modification is a biologically regulated process. To investigate the mechanism of 3' nucleotide additions, we used RNA interference to screen a panel of eight candidate miRNA nucleotidyl transferases for 3' miRNA modification activity in human cells. Multiple enzymes, including MTPAP, PAPD4, PAPD5, ZCCHC6, ZCCHC11, and TUT1, were found to govern 3' nucleotide addition to miRNAs in a miRNA-specific manner. Three of these enzymes-MTPAP, ZCCHC6, and TUT1-have not previously been known to modify miRNAs. Collectively, our results indicate that 3' modification observed in next-generation small RNA sequencing data is a biologically relevant process, and identify enzymatic mechanisms that may lead to new approaches for modulating miRNA activity in vivo.},

To investigate the mechanisms associated with AZA resistance in vitro, we generated AZA-resistant SKM1 myeloid cells, called hereafter AZA-R. AZA-R cells exhibit impaired mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and caspase activation in response to AZA compared to their AZA-sensitive (AZA-S) counterpart. AZA induced LC3-II accumulation and cathepsin B activity in AZA-S cells, two hallmarks of autophagy. AZA-R cells displayed increased basal autophagy but are resistant to AZA-mediated autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy using LC3 siRNA revealed that autophagy is protective in AZA-S cells and AZA-R cells in basal conditions. By contrast, AZA-R cells exhibited impaired autophagy in response to AZA. Collectively, our findings indicate that AZA promotes apoptosis and autophagy in SKM1 cells, and that AZA-R cells are resistant to both apoptosis and autophagy induced by AZA.},

abstract = {Small RNA RNA-seq for microRNAs (miRNAs) is a rapidly developing field where opportunities still exist to create better bioinformatics tools to process these large datasets and generate new, useful analyses. We built miRge to be a fast, smart small RNA-seq solution to process samples in a highly multiplexed fashion. miRge employs a Bayesian alignment approach, whereby reads are sequentially aligned against customized mature miRNA, hairpin miRNA, noncoding RNA and mRNA sequence libraries. miRNAs are summarized at the level of raw reads in addition to reads per million (RPM). Reads for all other RNA species (tRNA, rRNA, snoRNA, mRNA) are provided, which is useful for identifying potential contaminants and optimizing small RNA purification strategies. miRge was designed to optimally identify miRNA isomiRs and employs an entropy based statistical measurement to identify differential production of isomiRs. This allowed us to identify decreasing entropy in isomiRs as stem cells mature into retinal pigment epithelial cells. Conversely, we show that pancreatic tumor miRNAs have similar entropy to matched normal pancreatic tissues. In a head-to-head comparison with other miRNA analysis tools (miRExpress 2.0, sRNAbench, omiRAs, miRDeep2, Chimira, UEA small RNA Workbench), miRge was faster (4 to 32-fold) and was among the top-two methods in maximally aligning miRNAs reads per sample. Moreover, miRge has no inherent limits to its multiplexing. miRge was capable of simultaneously analyzing 100 small RNA-Seq samples in 52 minutes, providing an integrated analysis of miRNA expression across all samples. As miRge was designed for analysis of single as well as multiple samples, miRge is an ideal tool for high and low-throughput users. miRge is freely available at http://atlas.pathology.jhu.edu/baras/miRge.html.},

abstract = {The DNA methylation inhibitor azacitidine (5-azacytidine) is used against myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, but drug resistance is an ongoing, intractable problem. To investigate resistance mechanisms, we generated two azacitidine-resistant cell lines, THP-1/AR and HL60/AR, and studied genetic disparities between them and their corresponding parental lines. In cells treated with azacitidine, significant mitotic variations were noted in parental cells which were absent in resistant cells, suggesting that resistance arises from negating azacitidine-mediated activation of apoptosis signaling and reestablishing G2/M checkpoint. Importantly, both resistant cell lines have common point mutations in the uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2) gene, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of the azacitidine activation pathway. Forced expression of mutated UCK2 in parental THP-1 cells abrogated azacitidine-induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of wild type UCK2 in resistant THP-1/AR cells restored sensitivity to azacitidine, implying that UCK2 gene mutations perturb azacitidine activation and advance azacitidine resistance. Our study provides new insights into azacitidine resistance and establishes models useful in developing effective strategies to overcome it.},

Key to further elucidation of their roles is the generation of more complete lists of their numbers and expression changes in different cell states. Here, we report a new method for surveying the expression of small RNAs, including microRNAs, using Illumina sequencing technology. We also present a set of methods for annotating sequences deriving from known miRNAs, identifying variability in mature miRNA sequences, and identifying sequences belonging to previously unidentified miRNA genes. Application of this approach to RNA from human embryonic stem cells obtained before and after their differentiation into embryoid bodies revealed the sequences and expression levels of 334 known plus 104 novel miRNA genes. One hundred seventy-one known and 23 novel microRNA sequences exhibited significant expression differences between these two developmental states. Owing to the increased number of sequence reads, these libraries represent the deepest miRNA sampling to date, spanning nearly six orders of magnitude of expression. The predicted targets of those miRNAs enriched in either sample shared common features. Included among the high-ranked predicted gene targets are those implicated in differentiation, cell cycle control, programmed cell death, and transcriptional regulation.},

abstract = {Although papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) displays strong heritability, no predisposing germ-line mutations have been found. We show that a common G/C polymorphism (rs2910164) within the pre-miR-146a sequence reduced the amount of pre- and mature miR-146a from the C allele 1.9- and 1.8-fold, respectively, compared with the G allele. This is matched by a similar decrease in the amount of each pre-miR generated from the corresponding pri-miR-146a in an in vitro processing reaction. The C allele also interfered with the binding of a nuclear factor to pre-miR-146a. The reduction in miR-146a led to less efficient inhibition of target genes involved in the Toll-like receptor and cytokine signaling pathway (TRAF6, IRAK1), and PTC1 (also known as CCDC6 or H4), a gene frequently rearranged with RET proto-oncogene in PTC. In an association study of 608 PTC patients and 901 controls, we found marked differences in genotype distribution of rs2910164 (P = 0.000002), the GC heterozygous state being associated with an increased risk of acquiring PTC (odds ratio = 1.62, P = 0.000007), and both homozygous states protective with odds ratio = 0.42 for the CC genotype (P = 0.003) and odds ratio = 0.69 for the GG genotype (P = 0.0006). Moreover, 4.7{\%} of tumors had undergone somatic mutations of the SNP sequence. Thus, our data suggest that a common polymorphism in pre-miR-146a affects the miR expression, contributes to the genetic predisposition to PTC, and plays a role in the tumorigenesis through somatic mutation. Preliminary evidence suggests that these effects are mediated through target genes whose expression is affected by the SNP status.},

abstract = {Author SummaryThe cellular composition of heterogeneous samples can be predicted from reference gene expression profiles that represent the homogeneous, constituent populations of the heterogeneous samples. However, existing methods fail when the reference profiles are not representative of the constituent populations. We developed PERT, a new probabilistic expression deconvolution method, to address this limitation. PERT was used to deconvolve the cellular composition of variably sourced and treated heterogeneous human blood samples. Our results indicate that even after batch correction is applied, cells presenting the same cell surface antigens display different transcriptional programs when they are uncultured versus culture-derived. Given gene expression profiles of culture-derived heterogeneous samples and profiles of uncultured reference populations, PERT was able to accurately recover proportions of the constituent populations composing the heterogeneous samples. We anticipate that PERT will be widely applicable to expression deconvolution strategies that use profiles from reference populations that vary from the corresponding constituent populations in cellular state but not cellular phenotypic identity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Qualitative and quantitative analysis of small non-coding RNAs by next generation sequencing (smallRNA-Seq) represents a novel technology increasingly used to investigate with high sensitivity and specificity RNA population comprising microRNAs and other regulatory small transcripts. Analysis of smallRNA-Seq data to gather biologically relevant information, i.e. detection and differential expression analysis of known and novel non-coding RNAs, target prediction, etc., requires implementation of multiple statistical and bioinformatics tools from different sources, each focusing on a specific step of the analysis pipeline. As a consequence, the analytical workflow is slowed down by the need for continuous interventions by the operator, a critical factor when large numbers of datasets need to be analyzed at once.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We designed a novel modular pipeline (iMir) for comprehensive analysis of smallRNA-Seq data, comprising specific tools for adapter trimming, quality filtering, differential expression analysis, biological target prediction and other useful options by integrating multiple open source modules and resources in an automated workflow. As statistics is crucial in deep-sequencing data analysis, we devised and integrated in iMir tools based on different statistical approaches to allow the operator to analyze data rigorously. The pipeline created here proved to be efficient and time-saving than currently available methods and, in addition, flexible enough to allow the user to select the preferred combination of analytical steps. We present here the results obtained by applying this pipeline to analyze simultaneously 6 smallRNA-Seq datasets from either exponentially growing or growth-arrested human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, that led to the rapid and accurate identification, quantitation and differential expression analysis of {\~{}}450 miRNAs, including several novel miRNAs and isomiRs, as well as identification of the putative mRNA targets of differentially expressed miRNAs. In addition, iMir allowed also the identification of {\~{}}70 piRNAs (piwi-interacting RNAs), some of which differentially expressed in proliferating vs growth arrested cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The integrated data analysis pipeline described here is based on a reliable, flexible and fully automated workflow, useful to rapidly and efficiently analyze high-throughput smallRNA-Seq data, such as those produced by the most recent high-performance next generation sequencers. iMir is available at http://www.labmedmolge.unisa.it/inglese/research/imir.},

blasts within blood samples, has become increasingly important in
therapeutic disease monitoring. Modern flow cytometers enable researchers
to reliably measure six and more variables, describing cellular size,
granularity and expression of cell-surface and intracellular proteins,
for thousands of cells per second. Currently, analysis of cytometry
readouts relies on visual inspection and manual gating of one- or
two-dimensional projections of the data. This procedure, however,
is labor-intensive and misses potential characteristic patterns in
higher dimensions.RESULTS:Leukemic samples from patients with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia at initial diagnosis and during induction
therapy have been investigated by 4-color flow cytometry. We have
utilized multivariate classification techniques, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), to automate leukemic cell detection in cytometry. Classifiers
were built on conventionally diagnosed training data. We assessed
the detection accuracy on independent test data and analyzed marker
expression of incongruently classified cells. SVM classification
can recover manually gated leukemic cells with 99.78{\%} sensitivity
and 98.87{\%} specificity.CONCLUSION:Multivariate classification techniques
allow for automating cell population detection in cytometry readouts
for diagnostic purposes. They potentially reduce time, costs and
arbitrariness associated with these procedures. Due to their multivariate
classification rules, they also allow for the reliable detection
of small cell populations.},

abstract = {Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to all blood cells in a differentiation process that involves widespread epigenome remodeling. Here we present genome-wide reference maps of the associated DNA methylation dynamics. We used a meta-epigenomic approach that combines DNA methylation profiles across many small pools of cells and performed single-cell methylome sequencing to assess cell-to-cell heterogeneity. The resulting dataset identified characteristic differences between HSCs derived from fetal liver, cord blood, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. We also observed lineage-specific DNA methylation between myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, characterized immature multi-lymphoid progenitors, and detected progressive DNA methylation differences in maturing megakaryocytes. We linked these patterns to gene expression, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility, and we used machine learning to derive a model of human hematopoietic differentiation directly from DNA methylation data. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and provide a framework for studying blood-linked diseases.},

abstract = {BackgroundIn multivariate distributions (for example, in 3- or more color flow cytometric datasets), it can become difficult or impossible to identify populations that differ between samples based only on a combination of univariate or bivariate displays. Indeed, it is possible that such differences can only be identified in “n”-dimensional space, where “n” is the number of parameters measured. Therefore, computer assisted identification of such differences is necessary. Such a method could be used to identify responses (i.e., by comparing cell samples before and after stimulation) in exquisite detail by allowing complete analysis of the collected data on only those events which have responded.MethodsMultivariate Probability Binning can be used to compare different datasets to identify the distance and statistical significance of a difference between the distributions. An intermediate step in the algorithm provides access to the actual locations within the n-dimensional comparison which are most different between the distributions. Gates based on collections of hyper-rectangular bins can then be applied to datasets, thereby selecting those events (or clusters of events) that are different between samples. We term this process Frequency Difference Gating.ResultsFrequency Difference Gating was used in several test scenarios to evaluate its utility. First, we compared PBMC subsets identified by solely by immunofluorescence staining: based on this training data set, the algorithm automatically generated an accurate forward and side-scatter gate to identify lymphocytes. Second, we applied the algorithm to identify subtle differences between CD4 memory subsets based on 8-color immunophenotyping data. The resulting 3-dimensional gate could resolve cells subsets much more frequent in one subset compared to the other; no combination of two-dimensional gates could accomplish this resolution. Finally, we used the algorithm to compare B cell populations derived from mice of different ages or strains, and found that the algorithm could find very subtle differences between the populations.ConclusionFrequency Difference Gating is a powerful tool that automates the process of identifying events comprising underlying differences between samples. It is not a clustering tool; it is not meant to identify subsets in multidimensional space. Importantly, this method may reveal subtle changes in small populations of cells, changes that only occur simultaneously in multiple dimensions in such a way that identification by univariate or bivariate analyses is impossible. Finally, the method may significantly aid in the analysis of high-order multivariate data (i.e., 6-12 color flow cytometric analyses), where identification of differences between datasets becomes so time-consuming as to be impractical.

abstract = {Objective
In vitro culture systems that parallel in vivo growth conditions are needed to study leukemia biology and to accurately test therapeutic efficacies. We investigated the effects of the HS-5 human bone marrow stromal cell line on cultured primary leukemia cell survival and chemosensitivity.
Materials and Methods
A total of 30 bone marrow (BM) samples from untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients were cultured for 96 hours with serum and growth factors, without HS-5, or in direct contact with HS-5 monolayers, or with HS-5 separated from AML cells by transwell inserts. In some experiments, cytosine arabinoside or daunomycin was added for the last 18 hours of culture. Apoptosis frequencies, bcl-2 protein expression, proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, and cell cycle distributions were determined in four-color flow cytometry analyses of CD45+ leukemia cells.
Results
In comparison to control growth conditions, direct contact with HS-5 significantly inhibited culture-induced and drug-induced apoptosis of AML cells. Direct contact of AML cells with HS-5 significantly increased short-term proliferation and viability, and colony formation of primary AML cells. HS-5–mediated apoptosis inhibition was not consistently associated with increased bcl-2 protein in AML cells. Noncontact conditions inhibited drug-induced apoptosis significantly less than direct contact with HS-5.
Conclusion
Coculture of AML cells on HS-5 monolayers improved in vitro leukemia cell survival and attenuated chemotherapy-induced leukemia cell killing. This has practical significance, increasing the fraction of primary AML samples that can be analyzed in vitro, and allows drug sensitivity testing in growth conditions more similar to the bone marrow microenvironment.},

abstract = {Nucleosomes, the basic unit of chromatin, have a critical role in the control of gene expression. Nucleosome positions have generally been determined by examining bulk populations of cells and then correlated with overall gene expression. Here, we describe a technique to determine nucleosome positioning in single cells by virtue of the ability of the nucleosome to protect DNA from GpC methylation. In the acid phosphatase inducible PHO5 gene, we find that there is significant cell-to-cell variation in nucleosome positions and shifts in nucleosome positioning correlate with changes in gene expression. However, nucleosome positioning is not absolute, and even with major shifts in gene expression, some cells fail to change nucleosome configuration. Mutations of the PHO5 promoter that introduce a poly(dA:dT) tract-stimulated gene expression under nonpermissive conditions led to shifts of positioned nucleosomes similar to induction of PHO5. By contrast, mutations that altered AA/TT/AT periodicity reduced gene expression upon PHO5 induction and stabilized nucleosomes in most cells, suggesting that enhanced nucleosome affinity for DNA antagonizes chromatin remodelers. Finally, we determined nucleosome positioning in two regions described as "fuzzy" or nucleosome-free when examined in a bulk assay. These regions consisted of distinct nucleosomes with a larger footprint for potential location and an increase population of cells lacking a nucleosome altogether. These data indicate an underlying complexity of nucleosome positioning that may contribute to the flexibility and heterogeneity of gene expression.},

abstract = {Balanced chromosome rearrangements (BCRs) can cause genetic diseases by disrupting or inactivating specific genes, and the characterization of breakpoints in disease-associated BCRs has been instrumental in the molecular elucidation of a wide variety of genetic disorders. However, mapping chromosome breakpoints using traditional methods, such as in situ hybridization with fluorescent dye-labeled bacterial artificial chromosome clones (BAC-FISH), is rather laborious and time-consuming. In addition, the resolution of BAC-FISH is often insufficient to unequivocally identify the disrupted gene. To overcome these limitations, we have performed shotgun sequencing of flow-sorted derivative chromosomes using “next-generation” (Illumina/Solexa) multiplex sequencing-by-synthesis technology. As shown here for three different disease-associated BCRs, the coverage attained by this platform is sufficient to bridge the breakpoints by PCR amplification, and this procedure allows the determination of their exact nucleotide positions within a few weeks. Its implementation will greatly facilitate large-scale breakpoint mapping and gene finding in patients with disease-associated balanced translocations.},

abstract = {Summary
RNA-mediated gene silencing in human cells requires the accurate generation of ∼22 nt microRNAs (miRNAs) from double-stranded RNA substrates by the endonuclease Dicer. Although the phylogenetically conserved RNA-binding proteins TRBP and PACT are known to contribute to this process, their mode of Dicer binding and their genome-wide effects on miRNA processing have not been determined. We solved the crystal structure of the human Dicer-TRBP interface, revealing the structural basis of the interaction. Interface residues conserved between TRBP and PACT show that the proteins bind to Dicer in a similar manner and by mutual exclusion. Based on the structure, a catalytically active Dicer that cannot bind TRBP or PACT was designed and introduced into Dicer-deficient mammalian cells, revealing selective defects in guide strand selection. These results demonstrate the role of Dicer-associated RNA binding proteins in maintenance of gene silencing fidelity.},

abstract = {About 40{\%} of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) present with a normal karyotype, and they are facing different courses of disease. To advance the biological understanding and to find molecular prognostic markers, we performed a high-resolution oligonucleotide array study of 107 MDS patients (French American British) with a normal karyotype and clinical follow-up through the Duesseldorf MDS registry. Recurrent hidden deletions overlapping with known cytogenetic aberrations or sites of known tumor-associated genes were identified in 4q24 (TET2, 2x), 5q31.2 (2x), 7q22.1 (3x) and 21q22.12 (RUNX1, 2x). One patient with a 7q22.1 deletion had an additional 5q31.2 deletion of the acute myeloid leukemia/MDS region, the smallest deletion identified so far and including the putative tumor suppressor (ts) genes, EGR1 and CTNNA1. One TET2 deletion was homozygous and one heterozygous, with a missense mutation in the remaining allele, further supporting its role as a ts gene. Besides these recurrent alterations, additional individual imbalances were found in 34 cases; in total, 42/107 (39{\%}) cases had genomic imbalances. These patients had an inferior survival as compared with the rest of the patients (P=0.002). This study emphasizes the heterogeneity of MDS, but points to interesting genes that may have diagnostic and prognostic impact.},

Wishbone uses multi-dimensional single-cell data, such as mass cytometry or RNA-Seq data, as input and orders cells according to their developmental progression, and it pinpoints bifurcation points by labeling each cell as pre-bifurcation or as one of two post-bifurcation cell fates. Using 30-channel mass cytometry data, we show that Wishbone accurately recovers the known stages of T-cell development in the mouse thymus, including the bifurcation point. We also apply the algorithm to mouse myeloid differentiation and demonstrate its generalization to additional lineages. A comparison of Wishbone to diffusion maps, SCUBA and Monocle shows that it outperforms these methods both in the accuracy of ordering cells and in the correct identification of branch points.},

@article{Cron2013,
abstract = {Author SummaryThe use of flow cytometry to count antigen-specific T cells is essential for vaccine development, monitoring of immune-based therapies and immune biomarker discovery. Analysis of such data is challenging because antigen-specific cells are often present in frequencies of less than 1 in 1,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Standard analysis of flow cytometry data relies on visual identification of cell subsets by experts, a process that is subjective and often difficult to reproduce. Consequently, there is intense interest in automated approaches for cell subset identification. One popular class of such automated approaches is the use of statistical mixture models. We propose a hierarchical extension of statistical mixture models that has two advantages over standard mixture models. First, it increases the ability to detect extremely rare event clusters that are present in multiple samples. Second, it enables direct comparison of cell subsets by aligning clusters across multiple samples in a natural way arising from the hierarchical formulation. We demonstrate the algorithm on clinically relevant reference PBMC samples with known frequencies of CD8 T cells engineered to express T cell receptors specific for the cancer-testis antigen (NY-ESO-1) and compare its performance with other popular automated analysis approaches.},

abstract = {While DNA methylation is usually thought to be symmetrical across both alleles, there are some notable exceptions. Genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation are two well-studied sources of allele-specific methylation (ASM), but recent research has indicated a more complex pattern in which genotypic variation can be associated with allelically-skewed DNA methylation in cis. Given the known heterogeneity of DNA methylation across tissues and cell types we explored inter- and intra-individual variation in ASM across several regions of the human brain and whole blood from multiple individuals. Consistent with previous studies, we find widespread ASM with {\textgreater} 4{\%} of the ∼220,000 loci interrogated showing evidence of allelically-skewed DNA methylation. We identify ASM flanking known imprinted regions, and show that ASM sites are enriched in DNase I hypersensitivity sites and often located in an extended genomic context of intermediate DNA methylation. We also detect examples of genotype-driven ASM, some of which are tissue-specific. These findings contribute to our understanding of the nature of differential DNA methylation across tissues and have important implications for genetic studies of complex disease. As a resource to the community, ASM patterns across each of the tissues studied are available in a searchable online database: http://epigenetics.essex.ac.uk/ASMBrainBlood.},

The technology is now available and is highly competitive with imaging tools under the right conditions. Flow cytometry has, however, been a technology that has focused on its unique ability to study single cells and appropriate analytical tools are readily available to handle this traditional role of the technology.   Areas covered:  Expansion of flow cytometry to a high-throughput (HT) and high-content technology requires both advances in hardware and analytical tools. The historical perspective of flow cytometry operation as well as how the field has changed and what the key changes have been discussed. The authors provide a background and compelling arguments for moving toward HT flow, where there are many innovative opportunities. With alternative approaches now available for flow cytometry, there will be a considerable number of new applications. These opportunities show strong capability for drug screening and functional studies with cells in suspension.   Expert opinion:  There is no doubt that HT flow is a rich technology awaiting acceptance by the pharmaceutical community. It can provide a powerful phenotypic analytical toolset that has the capacity to change many current approaches to HT screening. The previous restrictions on the technology, based on its reduced capacity for sample throughput, are no longer a major issue. Overcoming this barrier has transformed a mature technology into one that can focus on systems biology questions not previously considered possible.},

abstract = {BACKGROUNDThe problem considered is the quantitative comparison of immunofluorescence frequency distributions in order to detect their differences of biological significance, i.e., to evaluate the potential positivity of a cell sample with respect to negative control cells. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistical test, proposed in the literature for this purpose, is examined and discussed through its application to a set of experimental measurements. It is shown that even differences due to the stain procedure or to instrumental biases may be considered significant by the test implemented in the standard form.METHODSIn order to ensure valid results, it is necessary to take into account the various sources of variation in the specific experimental context. A procedure is proposed that uses the KS statistics as a reference for determining an appropriate estimate of the overall variability in the control data. This estimate is derived from the comparisons of the cumulative distributions associated with repeated measurements of the negative cell sample.Results and Conclusions:The KS-related index thus defined provides a tool for assessing the potential positivity of a cell sample, since it allows to distinguish between statistical and biological significance of the difference between the histogram to be tested and the set of control data. In particular, if a cell sample is not included in the control variability, either a positive cell subpopulation is present, or all cells are positive. Instead, for a sample included in the control variability, the difference will be not biologically meaningful, even if statistically significant. Moreover, when a purely positive control sample is also available, it is possible to derive a measure of the precision at which a true biological positivity can be detected. Finally, since the index is not absolute, but relative to the features of the instrumentation, of the antibodies and of the fluorochromes used, it represents a quantitative measure of the stability and reproducibility of the measurement process and could be used for quality control of flow cytometric experiments in immunofluorescence.

abstract = {Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a high grade malignancy of non-lymphoid cells of the hematopoietic system. AML is a heterogeneous disease, and numerous attempts have been made to risk-stratify AML so that appropriate treatment can be offered. Single cell analysis methods could provide insights into the biology of AML leading to risk-stratified and functionally tailored treatments and hence improved outcomes. Recent advances in flow cytometry allow the simultaneous measurement of up to 17 antibody markers per cell for up to millions of cells, and it is performed routinely during AML clinical workup. However, despite vast amounts of flow cytometry data being gathered, comprehensive, objective and automated studies of this data have not been undertaken. Another method, strand-seq, elucidates template strand inheritance in single cells, with a range of potential applications, none of which had been automated when this thesis work commenced. I have developed bioinformatic methods enabling research into AML using both these types of data. I present flowBin, a method for faithfully recombining multitube flow cytometry data. I present flowType-DP, a new version of flowType, able to process flow cytometry and other single cell data having more than 12 markers (including flowBin output). I demonstrate the application of flowBin to AML data, for digitally isolating abnormal cells, and classifying AML patients. I also use flowBin in conjunction with flowType to find cell types associated with clinically relevant gene mutations in AML. I present BAIT, a software package for accurately detecting sister chromatid exchanges in strand-seq data. I present functionality to place unbridged contigs in late-build genomes into their correct location, and have, with collaborators, published the corrected locations of more than half the unplaced contigs in the current build of the mouse genome. I present contiBAIT, a software package for assembling early-build genomes which consist entirely of unanchored, unbridged contigs. ContiBAIT has the potential to dramatically improve the quality of many model organism genomes at low cost. These developments enable rapid, automated, objective and reproducible deep profiling of AML flow cytometry data, subclonal cell analysis of AML cytogenetics, and improvements to model organisms used in AML research.},

abstract = {Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing modifies RNA transcripts from their genomic blueprint. A prerequisite for this process is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structure. Such dsRNAs are formed as part of the microRNA (miRNA) maturation process, and it is therefore expected that miRNAs are affected by A-to-I editing. Editing of miRNAs has the potential to add another layer of complexity to gene regulation pathways, especially if editing occurs within the miRNA–mRNA recognition site. Thus, it is of interest to study the extent of this phenomenon. Current reports in the literature disagree on its extent; while some reports claim that it may be widespread, others deem the reported events as rare. Utilizing a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach supplemented by an extensive bioinformatic analysis, we were able to systematically identify A-to-I editing events in mature miRNAs derived from human brain tissues. Our algorithm successfully identified many of the known editing sites in mature miRNAs and revealed 17 novel human sites, 12 of which are in the recognition sites of the miRNAs. We confirmed most of the editing events using in vitro ADAR overexpression assays. The editing efficiency of most sites identified is very low. Similar results are obtained for publicly available data sets of mouse brain-regions tissues. Thus, we find that A-to-I editing does alter several miRNAs, but it is not widespread.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is a dynamic epigenetic mark that undergoes extensive changes during differentiation of self-renewing stem cells. However, whether these changes are the cause or consequence of stem cell fate remains unknown. Here, we show that alternative functional programs of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are governed by gradual differences in methylation levels. Constitutive methylation is essential for HSC self-renewal but dispensable for homing, cell cycle control and suppression of apoptosis. Notably, HSCs from mice with reduced DNA methyltransferase 1 activity cannot suppress key myeloerythroid regulators and thus can differentiate into myeloerythroid, but not lymphoid, progeny. A similar methylation dosage effect controls stem cell function in leukemia. These data identify DNA methylation as an essential epigenetic mechanism to protect stem cells from premature activation of predominant differentiation programs and suggest that methylation dynamics determine stem cell functions in tissue homeostasis and cancer.},

Herein, we performed a comprehensive analysis of miRNAs at the miRNA and isomiR levels in BC using next-generation sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Abnormally expressed miRNA (miR-21, miR-221, miR-155, miR-30e and miR-25) and isomiR profiles could be obtained at the miRNA and isomiR levels, and similar biological roles could be detected. IsomiR expression profiles should be further concerned, and especially isomiRs are actual regulatory molecules in the miRNA–mRNA regulatory networks. The study provides a comprehensive expression analysis at the miRNA and isomiR levels in BC, which indicates biological roles of isomiRs.},

abstract = {We have sequenced miRNA libraries from human embryonic, neural and foetal mesenchymal stem cells. We report that the majority of miRNA genes encode mature isomers that vary in size by one or more bases at the 3′ and/or 5′ end of the miRNA. Northern blotting for individual miRNAs showed that the proportions of isomiRs expressed by a single miRNA gene often differ between cell and tissue types. IsomiRs were readily co-immunoprecipitated with Argonaute proteins in vivo and were active in luciferase assays, indicating that they are functional. Bioinformatics analysis predicts substantial differences in targeting between miRNAs with minor 5′ differences and in support of this we report that a 5′ isomiR-9–1 gained the ability to inhibit the expression of DNMT3B and NCAM2 but lost the ability to inhibit CDH1 in vitro. This result was confirmed by the use of isomiR-specific sponges. Our analysis of the miRGator database indicates that a small percentage of human miRNA genes express isomiRs as the dominant transcript in certain cell types and analysis of miRBase shows that 5′ isomiRs have replaced canonical miRNAs many times during evolution. This strongly indicates that isomiRs are of functional importance and have contributed to the evolution of miRNA genes.},

abstract = {Polychromatic flow cytometry (PFC), has enormous power as a tool to dissect complex immune responses (such as those observed in HIV disease) at a single cell level. However, analysis tools are severely lacking. Although high-throughput systems allow rapid data collection from large cohorts, manual data analysis can take months. Moreover, identification of cell populations can be subjective and analysts rarely examine the entirety of the multidimensional dataset (focusing instead on a limited number of subsets, the biology of which has usually already been well-described). Thus, the value of PFC as a discovery tool is largely wasted. RESULTS: To address this problem, we developed a computational approach that automatically reveals all possible cell subsets. From tens of thousands of subsets, those that correlate strongly with clinical outcome are selected and grouped. Within each group, markers that have minimal relevance to the biological outcome are removed, thereby distilling the complex dataset into the simplest, most clinically relevant subsets. This allows complex information from PFC studies to be translated into clinical or resource-poor settings, where multiparametric analysis is less feasible. We demonstrate the utility of this approach in a large (n=466), retrospective, 14-parameter PFC study of early HIV infection, where we identify three T-cell subsets that strongly predict progression to AIDS (only one of which was identified by an initial manual analysis).

abstract = {Cancer-associated IDH mutations are characterized by neomorphic enzyme activity and resultant 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) production. Mutational and epigenetic profiling of a large acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient cohort revealed that IDH1/2-mutant AMLs display global DNA hypermethylation and a specific hypermethylation signature. Furthermore, expression of 2HG-producing IDH alleles in cells induced global DNA hypermethylation. In the AML cohort, IDH1/2 mutations were mutually exclusive with mutations in the $\alpha$-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme TET2, and TET2 loss-of-function mutations were associated with similar epigenetic defects as IDH1/2 mutants. Consistent with these genetic and epigenetic data, expression of IDH mutants impaired TET2 catalytic function in cells. Finally, either expression of mutant IDH1/2 or Tet2 depletion impaired hematopoietic differentiation and increased stem/progenitor cell marker expression, suggesting a shared proleukemogenic effect.},

abstract = {Genomes assembled de novo from short reads are highly fragmented relative to the finished chromosomes of Homo sapiens and key model organisms generated by the Human Genome Project. To address this problem, we need scalable, cost-effective methods to obtain assemblies with chromosome-scale contiguity. Here we show that genome-wide chromatin interaction data sets, such as those generated by Hi-C, are a rich source of long-range information for assigning, ordering and orienting genomic sequences to chromosomes, including across centromeres. To exploit this finding, we developed an algorithm that uses Hi-C data for ultra-long-range scaffolding of de novo genome assemblies. We demonstrate the approach by combining shotgun fragment and short jump mate-pair sequences with Hi-C data to generate chromosome-scale de novo assemblies of the human, mouse and Drosophila genomes, achieving—for the human genome—98{\%} accuracy in assigning scaffolds to chromosome groups and 99{\%} accuracy in ordering and orienting scaffolds within chromosome groups. Hi-C data can also be used to validate chromosomal translocations in cancer genomes.},

abstract = {Transcription factor GATA-1 is required for erythropoiesis, yet its full actions are unknown. We performed transcriptome analysis of G1E-ER4 cells, a GATA-1–null erythroblast line that undergoes synchronous erythroid maturation when GATA-1 activity is restored. We interrogated more than 9000 transcripts at 6 time points representing the transition from late burst forming unit–erythroid (BFU-E) to basophilic erythroblast stages. Our findings illuminate several new aspects of GATA-1 function. First, the large number of genes responding quickly to restoration of GATA-1 extends the repertoire of its potential targets. Second, many transcripts were rapidly down-regulated, highlighting the importance of GATA-1 in gene repression. Third, up-regulation of some known GATA-1 targets was delayed, suggesting that auxiliary factors are required. For example, induction of the direct GATA-1 target gene $\beta$ major globin was late and, surprisingly, required new protein synthesis. In contrast, the gene encoding Fog1, which cooperates with GATA-1 in $\beta$ globin transcription, was rapidly induced independently of protein synthesis. Guided by bioinformatic analysis, we demonstrated that selected regions of the Fog1 gene exhibit enhancer activity and in vivo occupancy by GATA-1. These findings define a regulatory loop for $\beta$ globin expression and, more generally, demonstrate how transcriptome analysis can be used to generate testable hypotheses regarding transcriptional networks.},

@article{Chowdhury2013a,
abstract = {Motivation: Development and progression of solid tumors can be attributed to a process of mutations, which typically includes changes in the number of copies of genes or genomic regions. Although comparisons of cells within single tumors show extensive heterogeneity, recurring features of their evolutionary process may be discerned by comparing multiple regions or cells of a tumor. A useful source of data for studying likely progression of individual tumors is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which allows one to count copy numbers of several genes in hundreds of single cells. Novel algorithms for interpreting such data phylogenetically are needed, however, to reconstruct likely evolutionary trajectories from states of single cells and facilitate analysis of tumor evolution.
Results: In this article, we develop phylogenetic methods to infer likely models of tumor progression using FISH copy number data and apply them to a study of FISH data from two cancer types. Statistical analyses of topological characteristics of the tree-based model provide insights into likely tumor progression pathways consistent with the prior literature. Furthermore, tree statistics from the resulting phylogenies can be used as features for prediction methods. This results in improved accuracy, relative to unstructured gene copy number data, at predicting tumor state and future metastasis.

abstract = {Aims Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) exhibit clinical efficacy in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN). This study was performed to assess residual disease status by flow cytometry immunophenotyping (FCI) methods in patients with MDS or MDS/MPN treated with HMAs, and correlate the findings with clinical response.Methods CD34+ myeloid precursors were assessed in 85 patients with MDS and MDS/MPN treated with HMAs using FCI methods. Morphological, cytogenetic and molecular assessments were performed to evaluate the responses.Results After a median six cycles (3–19) of HMAs, 40 (47{\%}) patients showed haematological improvement, 26 (63{\%}) showed bone marrow (BM) and 20 (39{\%}) cytogenetic response. However, CD34+ myeloid progenitors showed persistent immunophenotypic aberrancies in 72 (85{\%}) patients, indeterminate in four (5{\%}) and negative in nine (10{\%}). Compared with pretreatment BM in a given patient, FCI abnormalities were reduced in 15 (20{\%}) patients, similar in 37 (48{\%}), increased in 15 (20{\%}) and showed antigenic shift in nine (12{\%}). Patients who achieved immunophenotypic improvement had a superior progression-free survival (p=0.031). In the subgroup of patients who underwent haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), 16/19 (84{\%}) patients who had a pre-HSCT positive FCI study became normal.Conclusions These findings show the difficulty in eradicating neoplastic myeloid precursors by HMA therapy, thereby resulting in ultimate treatment failure in most patients. Achieving immunophenotypic improvement helps to identify patients who may benefit from continuous HMA treatment. HSCT provides a potential cure for these patients by replenishing BM with normal haematopoietic stem cells. },

To achieve a comprehensive assessment of methylation fidelity, we implemented a genome-scale hairpin bisulfite sequencing approach to generate methylation data for DNA double strands simultaneously. We show here that methylation fidelity is increasing globally during differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and is particularly high in the promoter regions of actively expressed genes and positively correlated with active histone modification marks and binding of transcriptional factors. The majority of intermediately (40{\%}-60{\%}) methylated CpG dinucleotides are hemi-methylated and with low methylation fidelity, particularly in the differentiating mESCs. However, while 5-hmC and 5-mC tend to coexist, there is no significant correlation between 5hmC levels and methylation fidelity. Our findings may shed new light on our understanding of the origins of methylation variations and the mechanisms underlying DNA methylation transmission.},

abstract = {Prior work has shown that heterozygosity G/C of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP rs2910164) within the precursor of microRNA-146a predisposes to PTC (odds ratio = 1.62, P = 0.000007) although the mechanism was unclear. Here, we show that GC heterozygotes differ from both GG and CC homozygotes by producing 3 mature microRNAs: 1 from the leading strand (miR-146a), and 2 from the passenger strand (miR-146a*G and miR-146a*C), each with its distinct set of target genes. TaqMan analysis of paired tumor/normal samples revealed 1.5- to 2.6-fold overexpression of polymorphic miR-146a* in 7 of 8 tumors compared with the unaffected part of the same gland. The microarray data showed that widely different transcriptomes occurred in the tumors and in unaffected parts of the thyroid from GC and GG patients. The modulated genes are mainly involved in regulation of apoptosis leading to exaggerated DNA-damage response in heterozygotes potentially explaining the predisposition to cancer. We propose that contrary to previously held views transcripts from the passenger strand of miRs can profoundly affect the downstream effects. Heterozygosity for polymorphisms within the premiR sequence can cause epistasis through the production of additional mature miRs. We propose that mature miRs from the passenger strand may regulate many genetic processes.},

abstract = {High-throughput biological assays such as microarrays let us ask very detailed questions about how diseases operate, and promise to let us personalize therapy. Data processing, however, is often not described well enough to allow for exact reproduction of the results, leading to exercises in “forensic bioinformatics” where aspects of raw data and reported results are used to infer what methods must have been employed. Unfortunately, poor documentation can shift from an inconvenience to an active danger when it obscures not just methods but errors. In this report we examine several related papers purporting to use microarray-based signatures of drug sensitivity derived from cell lines to predict patient response. Patients in clinical trials are currently being allocated to treatment arms on the basis of these results. However, we show in five case studies that the results incorporate several simple errors that may be putting patients at risk. One theme that emerges is that the most common errors are simple (e.g., row or column offsets); conversely, it is our experience that the most simple errors are common.

abstract = {Traditional methods for flow cytometry (FCM) data processing rely on subjective manual gating. Recently, several groups have developed computational methods for identifying cell populations in multidimensional FCM data. The Flow Cytometry: Critical Assessment of Population Identification Methods (FlowCAP) challenges were established to compare the performance of these methods on two tasks: (i) mammalian cell population identification, to determine whether automated algorithms can reproduce expert manual gating and (ii) sample classification, to determine whether analysis pipelines can identify characteristics that correlate with external variables (such as clinical outcome). This analysis presents the results of the first FlowCAP challenges. Several methods performed well as compared to manual gating or external variables using statistical performance measures, which suggests that automated methods have reached a sufficient level of maturity and accuracy for reliable use in FCM data analysis.},

@article{Boele2014,
abstract = {Next-generation sequencing experiments have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are expressed in many different isoforms (isomiRs), whose biological relevance is often unclear. We found that mature miR-21, the most widely researched miRNA because of its importance in human disease, is produced in two prevalent isomiR forms that differ by 1 nt at their 3′ end, and moreover that the 3′ end of miR-21 is posttranscriptionally adenylated by the noncanonical poly(A) polymerase PAPD5. PAPD5 knockdown caused an increase in the miR-21 expression level, suggesting that PAPD5-mediated adenylation of miR-21 leads to its degradation. Exoribonuclease knockdown experiments followed by small-RNA sequencing suggested that PARN degrades miR-21 in the 3′-to-5′ direction. In accordance with this model, microarray expression profiling demonstrated that PAPD5 knockdown results in a down-regulation of miR-21 target mRNAs. We found that disruption of the miR-21 adenylation and degradation pathway is a general feature in tumors across a wide range of tissues, as evidenced by data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, as well as in the noncancerous proliferative disease psoriasis. We conclude that PAPD5 and PARN mediate degradation of oncogenic miRNA miR-21 through a tailing and trimming process, and that this pathway is disrupted in cancer and other proliferative diseases.},

abstract = {Flow cytometry has become an essential tool for identification and characterization of hematological cancers and now, due to technological improvements, allows the identification and rapid enumeration of small tumor populations that may be present after induction therapy (minimal residual disease, MRD). The quantitation of MRD has been shown to correlate with relapse and survival rates in numerous diseases and in certain cases, and evidence of MRD is used to alter treatment protocols. Recent improvements in hardware allow for high data rate collection. Improved fluorochromes take advantage of violet laser excitation and maximize signal-to-noise ratio allowing the population of interest to be isolated in multiparameter space. This isolation, together with a low background rate, permits for detection of residual tumor populations in a background of normal cells. When counting such rare events, the distribution is governed by Poisson statistics, with precision increasing with higher numbers of cells collected. In several hematological malignancies, identification of populations at frequencies of 0.01{\%} and lower has been attained. The choice of antibodies used in MRD detection facilitates the definition of a fingerprint to identify abnormal populations throughout treatment. Tumor populations can change phenotype, and an approach that relies on ‘different from normal' has proven useful, particularly in the acute leukemias. Flow cytometry can and is used for detection of MRD in many hematological diseases; however, standardized approaches for specific diseases must be developed to ensure precise identification and enumeration that may alter the course of patient treatment.},

abstract = {Despite advances in the understanding of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) biology, only the clinically based International Prognostic Index (IPI) is used routinely for risk stratification at diagnosis. To find novel prognostic markers, we analyzed flow cytometric data from 229 diagnostic DLBCL samples using an automated multiparameter data analysis approach developed in our laboratory. By using the developed automated data analysis pipeline, we identified 71 of 229 cases as having more than 35{\%} B cells with a high side scatter (SSC) profile, a parameter reflecting internal cellular complexity. This high SSC B-cell feature was associated with inferior overall and progression-free survival (P = .001 and P = .01, respectively) and remained a significant predictor of overall survival in multivariate Cox regression analysis (IPI, P = .001; high SSC, P = .004; rituximab, P = .53)., This study suggests that high SSC among B cells may serve as a useful biomarker to identify patients with DLBCL at high risk for relapse. This is of particular interest because this biomarker is readily available in most clinical laboratories without significant alteration to existing routine diagnostic strategies or incurring additional costs.},

@article{Frohling2002a,
abstract = {PURPOSE: To prospectively compare cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic analysis for the detection of the most relevant chromosome abnormalities in a large series of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred forty consecutive adult patients with AML entered onto the multicenter treatment trial AML HD93 were studied. Chromosome banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) applying a comprehensive set of genomic DNA probes were performed in a single reference laboratory.
RESULTS: Two cases of inv(16), three cases of t(11q23), and three cases of t(8;21)var were only detected by molecular cytogenetics. By FISH, aberrations were identified in three cases with normal karyotypes: inv(16), −Y (in a patient with low metaphase yield on chromosome banding) and a 12p microdeletion. Additional aneuploidies, in particular +8q and +11q, were diagnosed by FISH; however, virtually all these aberrations occurred in patients with complex karyotypes or as an additional abnormality in leukemias with an AML-specific translocation. Finally, aberrations were detected by FISH in eight of 14 patients with no assessable metaphases.
CONCLUSION: In most cases of AML, conventional cytogenetic study reliably detects chromosomal abnormalities, and this method should not be replaced by FISH. FISH should be used as a complementary method for the detection of more subtle abnormalities, such as inv(16) and t(11q23), in all patients with newly diagnosed AML and for suspected t(8;21)var. Furthermore, molecular cytogenetics using this comprehensive set of DNA probes provides a valuable diagnostic tool for patients with poor chromosome morphology, low or no yields of metaphase cells, or both.},

abstract = {Whole-genome shotgun bisulfite sequencing (WG-SBS) is currently the most powerful tool available for understanding genomewide cytosine methylation with single-base resolution; however, the high sequencing cost limits its widespread application, particularly for mammalian genomes. We mapped high- to low-coverage SBS short reads of mouse and human female developing germ cells to consensus sequences of repetitive elements that were multiplied in the respective host genome. This mapping strategy effectively identified active and evolutionarily young retrotransposon subfamilies and centromeric satellite repeats that were resistant to DNA demethylation during the investigated progressive stages of germ cell development. Notably, quantities of only tens of thousands of uniquely mapped reads provided sufficient sensitivity to allow for methylation analyses of multiple retrotransposons and satellite repeats in mice. Furthermore, we produced SBS results from single female murine germ cells by an improved multiplexing and amplification-free SBS method (scPBAT). The scPBAT results quantitatively provided ≥5× sequencing coverage for at least 30 repeats, and the individual methylation patterns detected were similar to the bulk cell-based results. Our single-cell methylome sequencing technique will allow researchers to investigate intergenic methylation characteristics from limited amounts of mammalian cells as well as cells from other organisms with genomic annotations.},

@article{Ge2012,
abstract = {Motivation: For flow cytometry data, there are two common approaches to the unsupervised clustering problem: one is based on the finite mixture model and the other on spatial exploration of the histograms. The former is computationally slow and has difficulty to identify clusters of irregular shapes. The latter approach cannot be applied directly to high-dimensional data as the computational time and memory become unmanageable and the estimated histogram is unreliable. An algorithm without these two problems would be very useful.
Results: In this article, we combine ideas from the finite mixture model and histogram spatial exploration. This new algorithm, which we call flowPeaks, can be applied directly to high-dimensional data and identify irregular shape clusters. The algorithm first uses K-means algorithm with a large K to partition the cell population into many small clusters. These partitioned data allow the generation of a smoothed density function using the finite mixture model. All local peaks are exhaustively searched by exploring the density function and the cells are clustered by the associated local peak. The algorithm flowPeaks is automatic, fast and reliable and robust to cluster shape and outliers. This algorithm has been applied to flow cytometry data and it has been compared with state of the art algorithms, including Misty Mountain, FLOCK, flowMeans, flowMerge and FLAME.

Our hybrid assembly markedly improves upon the contiguity observed from traditional shotgun sequencing approaches, with scaffold N50 values approaching 30 Mb, and we identified complex structural variants (SVs) missed by other high-throughput approaches. Furthermore, by combining Illumina short-read data with long reads, we phased both single-nucleotide variants and SVs, generating haplotypes with over 99{\%} consistency with previous trio-based studies.

abstract = {5q– syndrome is a subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome characterized by severe anemia and variable neutropenia but normal or high platelet counts with dysplastic megakaryocytes. We examined expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) encoded on chromosome 5q as a possible cause of haploinsufficiency. We show that deletion of chromosome 5q correlates with loss of two miRNAs that are abundant in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), miR-145 and miR-146a, and we identify Toll–interleukin-1 receptor domain–containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) and tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor-6 (TRAF6) as respective targets of these miRNAs. TIRAP is known to lie upstream of TRAF6 in innate immune signaling. Knockdown of miR-145 and miR-146a together or enforced expression of TRAF6 in mouse HSPCs resulted in thrombocytosis, mild neutropenia and megakaryocytic dysplasia. A subset of mice transplanted with TRAF6-expressing marrow progressed either to marrow failure or acute myeloid leukemia. Thus, inappropriate activation of innate immune signals in HSPCs phenocopies several clinical features of 5q– syndrome.},

abstract = {The increased use of Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSC) to reconstitute hematopoiesis in autotransplant and, more recently, allotransplant settings has not been associated with a consensus means to quality control the PBSC product. Since the small population of cells that bear the CD34 antigen are thought to be responsible for multilineage engraftment, graft assessment by flow cytometric quantitation of CD34+ cells should provide a rapid, reliable, and reproducible assay. Unfortunately, although a number of flow cytometric assays for CD34 enumeration have been described, the lack of a standardized method has led to the generation of widely divergent data. Furthermore, none of these assays has been validated as to interlaboratory reproducibility and suitability for widespread clinical application. In early 1995, the International Society of Hematotherapy and Graft Engineering (ISHAGE) established a Stem Cell Enumeration Committee, the mandate of which was to validate a simple, rapid, and sensitive flow cytometric method to quantitate CD34+ cells in peripheral blood and apheresis products. We also sought to establish its utility on a variety of flow cytometers in clinical laboratories and its reproducibility between transplant centers. Here, we describe the four-parameter flow methodology adopted by ISHAGE for validation in a multicenter study in North America.},

Cellular DNA content is quantitated by Chromomycin A3 fluorescence and cell size is quantitated by 90 degrees light scatter; the logarithms of the measured intensities are used to produce a two parameter histogram. To determine the cell types responsible for signals in various histogram regions, systematic electronic cell sorting is performed. The sorted fractions are sedimented into microscope slides and stained by the Papanicolaou technique. The cells in each fraction are identified by conventional cytomorphologic criteria. Morphologic analysis of sorted cells reveals histogram regions corresponding to specific cell types. One very important region contains the highest concentration of signals from abnormal cells and is therefore the best region to analyze for specimen abnormality. However, because a significant number of signals in this region are from normal cells, specimens cannot be diagnosed by their analysis. Another important histogram region is composed primarily of signals from endocervical columnar and metaplastic cells. The presence of such cells is a good criterion for specimen adequacy, therefore analysis of signals in this region is essential to assess specimen adequacy for automatic screening.},

abstract = {Human leukemias are typified by acquired recurring chromosomal translocations. Cloning of these translocation breakpoints has provided important insights into pathogenesis of disease as well as novel therapeutic approaches. Chronic myelogenous leukemias (CML) are caused by constitutively activated tyrosine kinases, such as BCR/ABL, that confer a proliferative and survival advantage to hematopoietic progenitors but do not affect differentiation. These activated kinases are validated targets for therapy with selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors, a paradigm that may have broad applications in treatment of hematologic malignancies as well as solid tumors. Chromosomal translocations in acute myeloid leukemias (AML) most often result in loss-of-function mutations in transcription factors that are required for normal hematopoietic development. These latter mutations, however, are not sufficient to cause AML. The available evidence indicates that activating mutations in the hematopoietic tyrosine kinases FLT3 and c-KIT, and in N-RAS and K-RAS, confer proliferative advantage to hematopoietic progenitors and cooperate with loss-of-function mutations in hematopoietic transcription factors to cause an acute leukemia phenotype characterized by proliferation and impaired differentiation. The data supporting this hypothesis and the clinical and therapeutic implications of these observations are reviewed.},

abstract = {Background
Evidence has shown that single nucleotide polymorphism located in pre-miRNA or mature microRNA may modify various biological processes and affect the processing of carcinogenesis. Published results about the association between miR-146a rs2910164 G/C polymorphism and human gastric cancer susceptibility are inconclusive. The aim of this study was to acquire a more precise effect of the association between the miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism and gastric risk by meta-analysis.

Methods
Eligible genetic association studies were searched from PubMed, Web of Knowledge and Chinese Biomedicine Database on human subject. Quantitative data synthesis was conducted for the associations of miR-146a rs2910164 G/C polymorphism with susceptibility to gastric cancer.

Results
Nine eligible studies that included a total of 3,885 gastric cancer patients and 5,396 controls were identified in the present meta-analysis. The overall OR indicated a potential association between rs2910164 polymorphism and GC but the effect was not statistically significant (GG vs. CG/CC: OR = 1.076, 95{\%} CI 0.925-1.251, P = 0.342). When stratifying for population, the result showed that miR-146a rs2910164 GG genotype was associated with increased gastric cancer risk among Chinese in recessive model (GG vs. CG/CC: OR = 1.171, 95{\%} CI 1.050-1.306, P = 0.005). Besides, no significant difference was found in gender, smoking, location, metastasis of lymph node and Laur{\`{e}}n's classification.

Conclusions
The present meta-analysis suggests an increased risk between miR-146a rs2910164 GG genotype and gastric cancer susceptibility in Chinese based on published literatures.},

We present the readDepth package for R, which can detect these aberrations by measuring the depth of coverage obtained by massively parallel sequencing of the genome. In addition to achieving higher accuracy than existing packages, our tool runs much faster by utilizing multi-core architectures to parallelize the processing of these large data sets. In contrast to other published methods, readDepth does not require the sequencing of a reference sample, and uses a robust statistical model that accounts for overdispersed data. It includes a method for effectively increasing the resolution obtained from low-coverage experiments by utilizing breakpoint information from paired end sequencing to do positional refinement. We also demonstrate a method for inferring copy number using reads generated by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, thus enabling integrative study of epigenomic and copy number alterations. Finally, we apply this tool to two genomes, showing that it performs well on genomes sequenced to both low and high coverage. The readDepth package runs on Linux and MacOSX, is released under the Apache 2.0 license, and is available at http://code.google.com/p/readdepth/.},

The symmetrical four-armed chromatid interchanges are much more readily detected in peripheral blood lymphocytes of BS patients, suggesting that the frequency of somatic recombination is also increased. In the present study, the rate of spontaneous loss of HLA-A allele expression was estimated following fluctuation analysis in cultured T lymphocytes using a flow-cytometric assay. It was found to be 10 times or more higher than normal in lymphocytes from a BS patient. Molecular and chromosome analyses showed that all 13 independent variants from the patient were most likely derived from somatic recombinations. Further tests for loss of heterozygosity at a closely linked proximal locus, HLA-DQA1, showed that as many as half of the recombinants retained heterozygosity irrespective of the donor. The results suggest that the HLA region is hyperrecombinogenic in somatic cells and that the elevated recombination rate in BS cells results from the general increase at ordinary sites and not from random creation of unusual sites for recombination.},

abstract = {Acute leukemia is one of the leading malignancies in the United States
with a mortality rate strongly influenced by the phenotype. This
phenotype is based on detection of cell associated antigens normally
expressed during leucopoietic differentiation. In this regard, leukemia
classified as lymphoid or myeloid by phenotype is also classified
as a candidate for the corresponding chemotherapy protocol. Additionally,
the subtype of leukemia based on the degree of differentiation and
cell maturity influence prognosis, response to treatment, and median
survival times. In this paper, we analyze immunophenotype flow cytometry
data toward categorization of leukemia into subcategories based on
lineage and differentiation antigen expression. Twenty-eight inputs
(derived from the mean fluorescence intensity of up to 27 antibodies,
and an additional binary input denoting the past diagnosis of leukemia)
are used as input to a neural classifier to categorize a total of
170 cases into the lineage and differentiation categories of leukemia.
The neural classifier consisted of a feed forward network trained
using back propagation. A complexity regulation term (weight decay)
was used to improve the generalization performance of the neural
classifier. A training error of 0.0{\%} and a generalization error of
10.3{\%} was obtained for categorization based on lineage, while a training
error of 0.0{\%} and a generalization error of 10.0{\%} was obtained for
categorization based on differentiation. These results indicate that
objective classification of multifaceted phenotypes in leukemia can
be achieved for analyzing multiparameter data in flow cytometry and
further categorization into the prognostic subtypes.},

abstract = {BackgroundThe accurate prognosis definition to tailor treatment for early luminal invasive breast carcinoma patients remains challenging.Materials and MethodsTwo hundred fourteen early luminal breast carcinomas were genotyped with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) array to determine the number of chromosomal breakpoints as a marker of genomic instability. Proliferation was assessed by KI67 (immunohistochemistry) and genomic grade index (transcriptomic analysis). IHC3 (IHC4 score for HER2 negative tumors) was also determined.ResultsIn the training set (109 cases), the optimal cut-off was 34 breakpoints with a specificity of 0.94 and a sensitivity of 0.57 (Area under the curve (AUC): 0.81[0.71; 0.91]). In the validation set (105 cases), the outcome of patients with {\textgreater} 34 breakpoints (11 events / 22 patients) was poorer (logrank test p {\textless} 0.001; Relative Risk (RR): 3.7 [1.73; 7.92]), than that of patients with {\textless} 34 breakpoints (19 events / 83 patients).Whereas genomic grade and KI67 had a significant prognostic value in univariate analysis in contrast to IHC3 that failed to have a statistical significant prognostic value in this series, the number of breakpoints remained the only significant parameter predictive of outcome (RR: 3.47, Confidence Interval (CI [1.29; 9.31], p = 0.014)) in multivariate analysis .ConclusionGenomic instability, defined herein as a high number of chromosomal breakpoints, in early stage luminal breast carcinoma is a stronger prognostic marker than proliferation.},

@article{Geeleher2013a,
abstract = {Motivation: DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that can stably repress gene expression. Because of its biological and clinical significance, several methods have been developed to compare genome-wide patterns of methylation between groups of samples. The application of gene set analysis to identify relevant groups of genes that are enriched for differentially methylated genes is often a major component of the analysis of these data. This can be used, for example, to identify processes or pathways that are perturbed in disease development. We show that gene-set analysis, as it is typically applied to genome-wide methylation assays, is severely biased as a result of differences in the numbers of CpG sites associated with different classes of genes and gene promoters.
Results: We demonstrate this bias using published data from a study of differential CpG island methylation in lung cancer and a dataset we generated to study methylation changes in patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis. We show that several of the gene sets that seem enriched would also be identified with randomized data. We suggest two existing approaches that can be adapted to correct the bias. Accounting for the bias in the lung cancer and ulcerative colitis datasets provides novel biological insights into the role of methylation in cancer development and chronic inflammation, respectively. Our results have significant implications for many previous genome-wide methylation studies that have drawn conclusions on the basis of such strongly biased analysis.

abstract = {Cancer has been shown to result from the sequential acquisition of genetic alterations in a single lineage of cells. In leukemia, increasing evidence has supported the idea that this accumulation of mutations occurs in self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). These HSCs containing some, but not all, leukemia-specific mutations have been termed as pre-leukemic. Multiple recent studies have sought to understand these pre-leukemic HSCs and determine to what extent they contribute to leukemogenesis. These studies have elucidated patterns in mutation acquisition in leukemia, demonstrated resistance of pre-leukemic cells to standard induction chemotherapy and identified these pre-leukemic cells as a putative reservoir for the generation of relapsed disease. When combined with decades of research on clonal evolution in leukemia, mouse models of leukemogenesis, and recent massively parallel sequencing-based studies of primary patient leukemia, studies of pre-leukemic HSCs begin to piece together the evolutionary puzzle of leukemogenesis. These results have broad implications for leukemia treatment, targeted therapies, minimal residual disease monitoring and early detection screening.},

abstract = {We present single-cell clustering using bifurcation analysis (SCUBA), a novel computational method for extracting lineage relationships from single-cell gene expression data and modeling the dynamic changes associated with cell differentiation. SCUBA draws techniques from nonlinear dynamics and stochastic differential equation theories, providing a systematic framework for modeling complex processes involving multilineage specifications. By applying SCUBA to analyze two complementary, publicly available datasets we successfully reconstructed the cellular hierarchy during early development of mouse embryos, modeled the dynamic changes in gene expression patterns, and predicted the effects of perturbing key transcriptional regulators on inducing lineage biases. The results were robust with respect to experimental platform differences between RT-PCR and RNA sequencing. We selectively tested our predictions in Nanog mutants and found good agreement between SCUBA predictions and the experimental data. We further extended the utility of SCUBA by developing a method to reconstruct missing temporal-order information from a typical single-cell dataset. Analysis of a hematopoietic dataset suggests that our method is effective for reconstructing gene expression dynamics during human B-cell development. In summary, SCUBA provides a useful single-cell data analysis tool that is well-suited for the investigation of developmental processes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Identification of minor cell populations, e.g. leukemic
blasts within blood samples, has become increasingly important in
therapeutic disease monitoring. Modern flow cytometers enable researchers
to reliably measure six and more variables, describing cellular size,
granularity and expression of cell-surface and intracellular proteins,
for thousands of cells per second. Currently, analysis of cytometry
readouts relies on visual inspection and manual gating of one- or
two-dimensional projections of the data. This procedure, however,
is labor-intensive and misses potential characteristic patterns in
higher dimensions.RESULTS:Leukemic samples from patients with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia at initial diagnosis and during induction
therapy have been investigated by 4-color flow cytometry. We have
utilized multivariate classification techniques, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), to automate leukemic cell detection in cytometry. Classifiers
were built on conventionally diagnosed training data. We assessed
the detection accuracy on independent test data and analyzed marker
expression of incongruently classified cells. SVM classification
can recover manually gated leukemic cells with 99.78{\%} sensitivity
and 98.87{\%} specificity.CONCLUSION:Multivariate classification techniques
allow for automating cell population detection in cytometry readouts
for diagnostic purposes. They potentially reduce time, costs and
arbitrariness associated with these procedures. Due to their multivariate
classification rules, they also allow for the reliable detection
of small cell populations.},

abstract = {Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been thought to be the consequence of two broad complementation classes of mutations: class I and class II. However, overlap-mutations between them or within the same class and the position of TP53 mutation are not fully analyzed. We comprehensively analyzed the FLT3, cKIT, N-RAS, C/EBPA, AML1, MLL, NPM1, and TP53 mutations in 144 newly diagnosed de novo AML. We found 103 of 165 identified mutations were overlapped with other mutations, and most overlap-mutations consisted of class I and class II mutations. Although overlap-mutations within the same class were found in seven patients, five of them additionally had the other class mutation. These results suggest that most overlap-mutations within the same class might be the consequence of acquiring an additional mutation after the completion both of class I and class II mutations. However, mutated genes overlapped with the same class were limited in N-RAS, TP53, MLL-PTD, and NPM1, suggesting the possibility that these irregular overlap-mutations might cooperatively participate in the development of AML. Notably, TP53 mutation was overlapped with both class I and class II mutations, and associated with morphologic multilineage dysplasia and complex karyotype. The genotype consisting of complex karyotype and TP53 mutation was an unfavorable prognostic factor in entire AML patients, indicating this genotype generates a disease entity in de novo AML. These results collectively suggest that TP53 mutation might be a functionally distinguishable class of mutation.},

abstract = {Chromosomal deletions are common molecular events in myeloid malignancies. Heterozygous deletions may contain a tumor suppressor gene that undergoes homozygous inactivation or may contain one or more genes that alter the disease phenotype through haploinsufficiency. The most common karyotypic abnormality in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is deletion of chromosome 5q. A subset of patients with del(5q) as a sole cytogenetic abnormality has a consistent set of clinical features, termed the 5q- syndrome. While no tumor suppressor genes have been identified on 5q that are homozygously inactivated, recent studies have highlighted several genes and micro RNAs (miRNAs) that cause the phenotype of the 5q- syndrome through allelic insufficiency. For example, deletion of one allele of the RPS14 gene causes a severe defect in erythropoiesis, analogous to the congenital syndrome Diamond Blackfan anemia, which is itself caused by mutations that inactivate one allele of a ribosomal gene. Loss of one allele of miR-145 and miR-146a causes an increase in megakaryocyte production and may contribute to the clonal advantage of cells with del(5q). The functional approaches used to dissect the molecular basis of the 5q deletion in MDS have the potential to identify key genes and therapeutic targets within other chromosomal deletions in hematologic malignancies.},

Technologies that enable simultaneous and time-resolved measurements of these variables are necessary to dissect cellular homeostatic strategies. Here we report the development of an automated flow cytometry robotic setup that enables real-time measurement of precise and simultaneous relative growth and protein synthesis rates of multiplexed microbial populations across many conditions. These measurements generate quantitative profiles of dynamically evolving protein synthesis and degradation rates. We demonstrate this setup in the context of gene regulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and uncover a dynamic and complex landscape of gene expression, growth dynamics and proteolysis following perturbations.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, alternative cleavage of 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) can affect transcript stability, transport and translation. For polyadenylated (poly(A)) transcripts, cleavage sites can be characterized with short-read sequencing using specialized library construction methods. However, for large-scale cohort studies as well as for clinical sequencing applications, it is desirable to characterize such events using RNA-seq data, as the latter are already widely applied to identify other relevant information, such as mutations, alternative splicing and chimeric transcripts. Here we describe KLEAT, an analysis tool that uses de novo assembly of RNA-seq data to characterize cleavage sites on 3' UTRs. We demonstrate the performance of KLEAT on three cell line RNA-seq libraries constructed and sequenced by the ENCODE project, and assembled using Trans-ABySS. Validating the KLEAT predictions with matched ENCODE RNA-seq and RNA-PET libraries, we show that the tool has over 90{\%} positive predictive value when there are at least three RNA-seq reads supporting a poly(A) tail and requiring at least three RNA-PET reads mapping within 100 nucleotides as validation. We also compare the performance of KLEAT with other popular RNA-seq analysis pipelines that reconstruct 3' UTR ends, and show that it performs favourably, based on an ROC-like curve.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by binding to partially complementary sequences on target mRNA transcripts, thereby causing their degradation, deadenylation, or inhibiting their translation. Genomic variants can alter miRNA regulation by modifying miRNA target sites, and multiple human disease phenotypes have been linked to such miRNA target site variants (miR-TSVs). However, systematic genome-wide identification of functional miR-TSVs is difficult due to high false positive rates; functional miRNA recognition sequences can be as short as six nucleotides, with the human genome encoding thousands of miRNAs. Furthermore, while large-scale clinical genomic data sets are becoming increasingly commonplace, existing miR-TSV prediction methods are not designed to analyze these data. Here, we present an open-source tool called SubmiRine that is designed to perform efficient miR-TSV prediction systematically on variants identified in novel clinical genomic data sets. Most importantly, SubmiRine allows for the prioritization of predicted miR-TSVs according to their relative probability of being functional. We present the results of SubmiRine using integrated clinical genomic data from a large-scale cohort study on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), making a number of high-scoring, novel miR-TSV predictions. We also demonstrate SubmiRine's ability to predict and prioritize known miR-TSVs that have undergone experimental validation in previous studies.},

abstract = {Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of chronic hematological malignancies characterized by dysplasia, ineffective hematopoiesis and a variable risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Sequencing of MDS genomes has identified mutations in genes implicated in RNA splicing, DNA modification, chromatin regulation, and cell signaling. We sequenced 111 genes across 738 patients with MDS or closely related neoplasms (including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and MDS–myeloproliferative neoplasms) to explore the role of acquired mutations in MDS biology and clinical phenotype. Seventy-eight percent of patients had 1 or more oncogenic mutations. We identify complex patterns of pairwise association between genes, indicative of epistatic interactions involving components of the spliceosome machinery and epigenetic modifiers. Coupled with inferences on subclonal mutations, these data suggest a hypothesis of genetic “predestination,” in which early driver mutations, typically affecting genes involved in RNA splicing, dictate future trajectories of disease evolution with distinct clinical phenotypes. Driver mutations had equivalent prognostic significance, whether clonal or subclonal, and leukemia-free survival deteriorated steadily as numbers of driver mutations increased. Thus, analysis of oncogenic mutations in large, well-characterized cohorts of patients illustrates the interconnections between the cancer genome and disease biology, with considerable potential for clinical application.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Qualitative and quantitative analysis of small non-coding RNAs by next generation sequencing (smallRNA-Seq) represents a novel technology increasingly used to investigate with high sensitivity and specificity RNA population comprising microRNAs and other regulatory small transcripts. Analysis of smallRNA-Seq data to gather biologically relevant information, i.e. detection and differential expression analysis of known and novel non-coding RNAs, target prediction, etc., requires implementation of multiple statistical and bioinformatics tools from different sources, each focusing on a specific step of the analysis pipeline. As a consequence, the analytical workflow is slowed down by the need for continuous interventions by the operator, a critical factor when large numbers of datasets need to be analyzed at once.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We designed a novel modular pipeline (iMir) for comprehensive analysis of smallRNA-Seq data, comprising specific tools for adapter trimming, quality filtering, differential expression analysis, biological target prediction and other useful options by integrating multiple open source modules and resources in an automated workflow. As statistics is crucial in deep-sequencing data analysis, we devised and integrated in iMir tools based on different statistical approaches to allow the operator to analyze data rigorously. The pipeline created here proved to be efficient and time-saving than currently available methods and, in addition, flexible enough to allow the user to select the preferred combination of analytical steps. We present here the results obtained by applying this pipeline to analyze simultaneously 6 smallRNA-Seq datasets from either exponentially growing or growth-arrested human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, that led to the rapid and accurate identification, quantitation and differential expression analysis of {\~{}}450 miRNAs, including several novel miRNAs and isomiRs, as well as identification of the putative mRNA targets of differentially expressed miRNAs. In addition, iMir allowed also the identification of {\~{}}70 piRNAs (piwi-interacting RNAs), some of which differentially expressed in proliferating vs growth arrested cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The integrated data analysis pipeline described here is based on a reliable, flexible and fully automated workflow, useful to rapidly and efficiently analyze high-throughput smallRNA-Seq data, such as those produced by the most recent high-performance next generation sequencers. iMir is available at http://www.labmedmolge.unisa.it/inglese/research/imir.},

Here we report on our identification of numerous and abundant isomiRs in the lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) of 452 men and women from five different population groups. Unexpectedly, we find that these isomiRs exhibit an expression profile that is population-dependent and gender-dependent. This is important as it indicates that the LCLs of each gender/population combination have their own unique collection of mature miRNA transcripts. Moreover, each identified isomiR has its own characteristic abundance that remains consistent across biological replicates indicating that these are not degradation products. The primary sequences of identified isomiRs differ from the known miRBase miRNA either at their 5´-endpoint (leads to a different 'seed' sequence and suggests a different targetome), their 3´-endpoint, or both simultaneously. Our analysis of Argonaute PAR-CLIP data from LCLs supports the association of many of these newly identified isomiRs with the Argonaute silencing complex and thus their functional roles through participation in the RNA interference pathway.},

abstract = {Objective Fractures can initiate an immune response that disturbs osteoblastic and osteoclastic cellular homeostasis through cytokine production and release. The aim of our study was to investigate $\gamma$/$\delta$ T cells, innate lymphocytes known to be involved in tissue repair, as potential cellular components of the osteoimmune system's response to an in vivo model of bone injury. The absence of such cells or their effector cytokines influences the fate of other responder cells in proliferation, differentiation, matrix production, and ultimate callus formation. Methods Tibia fractures were created in 60 $\gamma$/$\delta$ T cell–deficient mice (also called $\delta$ T cell receptor [TCR]–knockout mice) and 60 control C57BL/6 mice. Analysis included radiographs, basic histology, mechanical testing, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical localization of $\gamma$/$\delta$ TCR–positive subsets from control animals and of CD44 expression from both groups, as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the effector cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN$\gamma$), and IL-6. Results Animals deficient in $\gamma$/$\delta$ T cells demonstrated more mature histologic elements and quantitative increases in the expression of major bone (bone sialoprotein) and cartilage (type II collagen) matrix proteins and in the expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 at a critical reparative phase. Moreover, only $\gamma$/$\delta$ T cell–deficient animals had a decrease in the osteoprogenitor antiproliferative cytokines IL-6 and IFN$\gamma$ at the reparative phase. The result was improved stability at the repair site and an overall superior biomechanical strength in $\gamma$/$\delta$ T cell–deficient mice compared with controls. Conclusion The evidence for a role of $\gamma$/$\delta$ T cells in the context of skeletal injury demonstrates the importance of the immune system's effect on bone biology, which is relevant to the field of osteoimmunology, and offers a potential molecular platform from which to develop essential therapeutic strategies.},

The transcriptional programs that govern hematopoiesis have been investigated primarily by population-level analysis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which cannot reveal the continuous nature of the differentiation process. Here we applied single-cell RNA-sequencing to a population of hematopoietic cells in zebrafish as they undergo thrombocyte lineage commitment. By reconstructing their developmental chronology computationally, we were able to place each cell along a continuum from stem cell to mature cell, refining the traditional lineage tree. The progression of cells along this continuum is characterized by a highly coordinated transcriptional program, displaying simultaneous suppression of genes involved in cell proliferation and ribosomal biogenesis as the expression of lineage specific genes increases. Within this program, there is substantial heterogeneity in the expression of the key lineage regulators. Overall, the total number of genes expressed, as well as the total mRNA content of the cell, decreases as the cells undergo lineage commitment.},

In this study, we present integrated quantitative proteome, transcriptome, and methylome analyses of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and four multipotent progenitor (MPP) populations. From the characterization of more than 6,000 proteins, 27,000 transcripts, and 15,000 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), we identified coordinated changes associated with early differentiation steps. DMRs show continuous gain or loss of methylation during differentiation, and the overall change in DNA methylation correlates inversely with gene expression at key loci. Our data reveal the differential expression landscape of 493 transcription factors and 682 lncRNAs and highlight specific expression clusters operating in HSCs. We also found an unexpectedly dynamic pattern of transcript isoform regulation, suggesting a critical regulatory role during HSC differentiation, and a cell cycle/DNA repair signature associated with multipotency in MPP2 cells. This study provides a comprehensive genome-wide resource for the functional exploration of molecular, cellular, and epigenetic regulation at the top of the hematopoietic hierarchy.},

abstract = {Cancer has been shown to result from the sequential acquisition of genetic alterations in a single lineage of cells. In leukemia, increasing evidence has supported the idea that this accumulation of mutations occurs in self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). These HSCs containing some, but not all, leukemia-specific mutations have been termed as pre-leukemic. Multiple recent studies have sought to understand these pre-leukemic HSCs and determine to what extent they contribute to leukemogenesis. These studies have elucidated patterns in mutation acquisition in leukemia, demonstrated resistance of pre-leukemic cells to standard induction chemotherapy and identified these pre-leukemic cells as a putative reservoir for the generation of relapsed disease. When combined with decades of research on clonal evolution in leukemia, mouse models of leukemogenesis, and recent massively parallel sequencing-based studies of primary patient leukemia, studies of pre-leukemic HSCs begin to piece together the evolutionary puzzle of leukemogenesis. These results have broad implications for leukemia treatment, targeted therapies, minimal residual disease monitoring and early detection screening.},

abstract = {Mirtrons are microRNA (miRNA) substrates that utilize the splicing machinery to bypass the necessity of Drosha cleavage for their biogenesis. Expanding our recent efforts for mammalian mirtron annotation, we use meta-analysis of aggregate datasets to identify {\~{}}500 novel mouse and human introns that confidently generate diced small RNA duplexes. These comprise nearly 1000 total loci distributed in four splicing-mediated biogenesis subclasses, with 5'-tailed mirtrons as, by far, the dominant subtype. Thus, mirtrons surprisingly comprise a substantial fraction of endogenous Dicer substrates in mammalian genomes. Although mirtron-derived small RNAs exhibit overall expression correlation with their host mRNAs, we observe a subset with substantial differences that suggest regulated processing or accumulation. We identify characteristic sequence, length, and structural features of mirtron loci that distinguish them from bulk introns, and find that mirtrons preferentially emerge from genes with larger numbers of introns. While mirtrons generate miRNA-class regulatory RNAs, we also find that mirtrons exhibit many features that distinguish them from canonical miRNAs. We observe that conventional mirtron hairpins are substantially longer than Drosha-generated pre-miRNAs, indicating that the characteristic length of canonical pre-miRNAs is not a general feature of Dicer substrate hairpins. In addition, mammalian mirtrons exhibit unique patterns of ordered 5' and 3' heterogeneity, which reveal hidden complexity in miRNA processing pathways. These include broad 3'-uridylation of mirtron hairpins, atypically heterogeneous 5' termini that may result from exonucleolytic processing, and occasionally robust decapitation of the 5' guanine (G) of mirtron-5p species defined by splicing. Altogether, this study reveals that this extensive class of non-canonical miRNA bears a multitude of characteristic properties, many of which raise general mechanistic questions regarding the processing of endogenous hairpin transcripts., Bulk miRNAs in most animal cells derive from cleavage of hairpin precursor transcripts by the Drosha and Dicer RNase III enzymes. A variety of non-canonical miRNA biogenesis strategies are known, including "mirtrons" for which splicing substitutes for Drosha. However, as non-canonical miRNAs usually account for a minor fraction of total miRNA reads, the alternate pathways are often considered of minor impact. In this study, we describe meta-analysis of {\textgreater}1000 mouse and human small RNA datasets, and surprisingly, find evidence of nearly 1000 mirtron using stringent criteria, half of which were novel annotations. Therefore, mirtrons comprise a substantial fraction of total Dicer substrates. We use this catalog to perform diverse sequence and structural analyses of mirtron loci that differentiate them from bulk introns and also to perform diverse comparisons of mirtrons and canonical miRNAs. Surprisingly, we find that many seemingly fundamental features of miRNA genes, which have been well-studied over the years, are not actually general features of miRNAs, but specifically those of hairpins that transit the Drosha-Dicer pathway. Instead, the nearly 1000 splicing-derived miRNAs reveal expanded and/or distinct properties encompassed by endogenous Dicer substrates in mammalian cells. These features reveal hidden impacts that shape miRNA processing, function, and evolution.},

abstract = {Human leukemias are typified by acquired recurring chromosomal translocations. Cloning of these translocation breakpoints has provided important insights into pathogenesis of disease as well as novel therapeutic approaches. Chronic myelogenous leukemias (CML) are caused by constitutively activated tyrosine kinases, such as BCR/ABL, that confer a proliferative and survival advantage to hematopoietic progenitors but do not affect differentiation. These activated kinases are validated targets for therapy with selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors, a paradigm that may have broad applications in treatment of hematologic malignancies as well as solid tumors. Chromosomal translocations in acute myeloid leukemias (AML) most often result in loss-of-function mutations in transcription factors that are required for normal hematopoietic development. These latter mutations, however, are not sufficient to cause AML. The available evidence indicates that activating mutations in the hematopoietic tyrosine kinases FLT3 and c-KIT, and in N-RAS and K-RAS, confer proliferative advantage to hematopoietic progenitors and cooperate with loss-of-function mutations in hematopoietic transcription factors to cause an acute leukemia phenotype characterized by proliferation and impaired differentiation. The data supporting this hypothesis and the clinical and therapeutic implications of these observations are reviewed.},

Its accuracy is compared to that of the channel-by-channel histogram subtraction method and to another currently used automated method, which selects an integration window by finding the channels that contain the most fluorescent 2{\%} of a control histogram.The new histogram subtraction method is objective, easy to use, and is more accurate than other currently used automated analysis methods. PASCAL source code is given for each method of analysis.},

abstract = {In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the cell of origin, nature and biological consequences of initiating lesions, and order of subsequent mutations remain poorly understood, as AML is typically diagnosed without observation of a pre-leukaemic phase. Here, highly purified haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), progenitor and mature cell fractions from the blood of AML patients were found to contain recurrent DNMT3A mutations (DNMT3Amut) at high allele frequency, but without coincident NPM1 mutations (NPM1c) present in AML blasts. DNMT3Amut-bearing HSCs showed a multilineage repopulation advantage over non-mutated HSCs in xenografts, establishing their identity as pre-leukaemic HSCs. Pre-leukaemic HSCs were found in remission samples, indicating that they survive chemotherapy. Therefore DNMT3Amut arises early in AML evolution, probably in HSCs, leading to a clonally expanded pool of pre-leukaemic HSCs from which AML evolves. Our findings provide a paradigm for the detection and treatment of pre-leukaemic clones before the acquisition of additional genetic lesions engenders greater therapeutic resistance.},

abstract = {We developed the Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT) to analyze the functional significance of cis-regulatory regions identified by localized measurements of DNA binding events across an entire genome. Whereas previous methods took into account only binding proximal to genes, GREAT is able to properly incorporate distal binding sites and control for false positives using a binomial test over the input genomic regions. GREAT incorporates annotations from 20 ontologies and is available as a web application. Applying GREAT to data sets from chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) of multiple transcription-associated factors, including SRF, NRSF, GABP, Stat3 and p300 in different developmental contexts, we recover many functions of these factors that are missed by existing gene-based tools, and we generate testable hypotheses. The utility of GREAT is not limited to ChIP-seq, as it could also be applied to open chromatin, localized epigenomic markers and similar functional data sets, as well as comparative genomics sets.

abstract = {Conventional analysis of flow cytometric data requires that population
identification be performed graphically after a sample has been run
using two-parameter scatter plots. As more parameters are measured,
the number of possible two-parameter plots increases geometrically,
making data analysis increasingly cumbersome. Artificial Neural Systems
(ANS), also known as neural networks, are a powerful and convenient
method for overcoming this data bottleneck. ANS "learn" to make classifications
using all of the measured parameters simultaneously. Mathematical
models and programming expertise are not required. ANS are inherently
parallel so that high processing speed can be achieved. Because ANS
are nonlinear, curved class boundaries and other nonlinearities can
emerge naturally. Here, we present biomedical and oceanographic data
to demonstrate the useful properties of neural networks for processing
and analyzing flow cytometry data. We show that ANS are equally useful
for human leukocytes and marine plankton data. They can easily accommodate
nonlinear variations in data, detect subtle changes in measurements,
interpolate and classify cells they were not trained on, and analyze
multiparameter cell data in real time. Real-time classification of
a mixture of six cyanobacteria strains was achieved with an average
accuracy of 98{\%}.},

abstract = {The expression of CD4 and CD8$\alpha$$\beta$ co-receptors on mature T cells is generally considered to be mutually exclusive and reflects subset-related, specific functions (helper vs. cytolytic) and differences in major histocompatibility complex-restriction for antigen recognition. However, double positive (DP) T cells expressing both CD4 and CD8 have been described in several pathological conditions as well as in normal individuals. DP T cells represent a heterogeneous population. Strong evidence indicates that in vivo terminally differentiated effector CD4 may acquire the $\alpha$-chain of CD8. Reciprocally, in vitro activation of CD8+ T cells results in the expression of low levels of CD4 that may mediate HIV entry and responses to chemotactic cytokines. Particularly intriguing, a subset of DP T cells expressing high levels of both CD4 and CD8$\alpha$$\beta$ heterodimer (CD4hiCD8hi), has been identified in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders. While no definitive proof exists, it could be speculated that CD4hiCD8hi T cells may be endowed with auto-reactivity due to faulty thymic selection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical outcome for the individual prostate cancer patient is often difficult to predict, due to lack of reliable independent prognostic biomarkers. We tested DNA ploidy as a prognostic factor for clinical outcome in 186 patients treated with radical prostatectomy.
METHODS: DNA ploidy was measured using an automatic image cytometry system and correlated with preoperative PSA, age at surgery, Mostofi grade, surgical margins and Gleason score.
RESULTS: The mean follow up time after operation was 73.3 months (range 2-176 months). Of the 186 prostatectomies, 96 were identified as diploid, 61 as tetraploid and 29 as aneuploid. Twenty-three per cent, 36{\%} and 62{\%} of the diploid, tetraploid and aneuploid cases respectively, suffered from relapse during the observation time. DNA ploidy, Gleason score, Mostofi grading, surgical margins and preoperative PSA were all significant predictors of relapse in a univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, only Gleason score and DNA ploidy proved to be independently predictors of disease recurrence. Furthermore, among the 68 cases identified with Gleason score 7, DNA ploidy was the only significant predictor of disease recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that DNA ploidy should be included as an important additive prognostic factor for prostate cancer, especially for patients identified with Gleason score 7 tumours.},

abstract = {The naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is a strictly subterranean, extraordinarily long-lived eusocial mammal. Although it is the size of a mouse, its maximum lifespan exceeds 30 years, making this animal the longest-living rodent. Naked mole rats show negligible senescence, no age-related increase in mortality, and high fecundity until death. In addition to delayed ageing, they are resistant to both spontaneous cancer and experimentally induced tumorigenesis. Naked mole rats pose a challenge to the theories that link ageing, cancer and redox homeostasis. Although characterized by significant oxidative stress, the naked mole rat proteome does not show age-related susceptibility to oxidative damage or increased ubiquitination. Naked mole rats naturally reside in large colonies with a single breeding female, the /`queen/', who suppresses the sexual maturity of her subordinates. They also live in full darkness, at low oxygen and high carbon dioxide concentrations, and are unable to sustain thermogenesis nor feel certain types of pain. Here we report the sequencing and analysis of the naked mole rat genome, which reveals unique genome features and molecular adaptations consistent with cancer resistance, poikilothermy, hairlessness and insensitivity to low oxygen, and altered visual function, circadian rythms and taste sensing. This information provides insights into the naked mole rat/'s exceptional longevity and ability to live in hostile conditions, in the dark and at low oxygen. The extreme traits of the naked mole rat, together with the reported genome and transcriptome information, offer opportunities for understanding ageing and advancing other areas of biological and biomedical research.},

Based on these observations, miRNA-based anticancer therapies are being developed either alone or in combination with current targeted therapies, with the goal to improve disease response and increase cure rate. The advantage of using miRNA approaches is based on the ability to concurrently target multiple effectors of pathways involved in cell differentiation, proliferation and survival. In this review, we describe the role of miRNAs in tumorigenesis, and critically discuss the rationale, strategies and challenges for therapeutic targeting of miRNAs in cancer.},

Variants in miRNA genes can have profound effects on miRNA functionality at all levels, including miRNA transcription, maturation, and target specificity, and as such they can also contribute to disease. The impact of variants in miRNA genes is the focus of the present review. To put these effects into context, we first discuss the requirements of miRNA transcripts for maturation. In the last part an overview of available databases and tools and experimental approaches to investigate miRNA variants related to human disease is presented.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are neoplastic disorders of hematopoietic stem cells. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine), benefit some MDS/AML patients. However, the role of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor-induced DNA hypomethylation in regulation of gene expression in AML is unclear.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We compared the effects of 5-azacytidine on DNA methylation and gene expression using whole-genome single-nucleotide bisulfite-sequencing and RNA-sequencing in OCI-AML3 cells. For data analysis, we used an approach recently developed for discovery of differential patterns of DNA methylation associated with changes in gene expression, that is tailored to single-nucleotide bisulfite-sequencing data (Washington University Interpolated Methylation Signatures). Using this approach, we find that a subset of genes upregulated by 5-azacytidine are characterized by 5-azacytidine-induced signature methylation loss flanking the transcription start site. Many of these genes show increased methylation and decreased expression in OCI-AML3 cells compared to normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Moreover, these genes are preferentially upregulated by decitabine in human primary AML blasts, and control cell proliferation, death, and development.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our approach identifies a set of genes whose methylation and silencing in AML is reversed by DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. These genes are good candidates for direct regulation by DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, and their reactivation by DNA methyltransferase inhibitors may contribute to therapeutic activity.},

To understand global patterns of CpG island methylation in colorectal cancer, we have used a recently developed technique called methylated CpG island amplification to examine 30 newly cloned differentially methylated DNA sequences. Of these 30 clones, 19 (63{\%}) were progressively methylated in an age-dependent manner in normal colon, 7 (23{\%}) were methylated in a cancer-specific manner, and 4 (13{\%}) were methylated only in cell lines. Thus, a majority of CpG islands methylated in colon cancer are also methylated in a subset of normal colonic cells during the process of aging. In contrast, methylation of the cancer-specific clones was found exclusively in a subset of colorectal cancers, which appear to display a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). CIMP+ tumors also have a high incidence of p16 and THBS1 methylation, and they include the majority of sporadic colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability related to hMLH1 methylation. We thus define a pathway in colorectal cancer that appears to be responsible for the majority of sporadic tumors with mismatch repair deficiency.},

abstract = {Summary
RNA-mediated gene silencing in human cells requires the accurate generation of ∼22 nt microRNAs (miRNAs) from double-stranded RNA substrates by the endonuclease Dicer. Although the phylogenetically conserved RNA-binding proteins TRBP and PACT are known to contribute to this process, their mode of Dicer binding and their genome-wide effects on miRNA processing have not been determined. We solved the crystal structure of the human Dicer-TRBP interface, revealing the structural basis of the interaction. Interface residues conserved between TRBP and PACT show that the proteins bind to Dicer in a similar manner and by mutual exclusion. Based on the structure, a catalytically active Dicer that cannot bind TRBP or PACT was designed and introduced into Dicer-deficient mammalian cells, revealing selective defects in guide strand selection. These results demonstrate the role of Dicer-associated RNA binding proteins in maintenance of gene silencing fidelity.},

abstract = {Flow cytometry is used increasingly in clinical research for cancer, immunology and vaccines. Technological advances in cytometry instrumentation are increasing the size and dimensionality of data sets, posing a challenge for traditional data management and analysis. Automated analysis methods, despite a general consensus of their importance to the future of the field, have been slow to gain widespread adoption. Here we present OpenCyto, a new BioConductor infrastructure and data analysis framework designed to lower the barrier of entry to automated flow data analysis algorithms by addressing key areas that we believe have held back wider adoption of automated approaches. OpenCyto supports end-to-end data analysis that is robust and reproducible while generating results that are easy to interpret. We have improved the existing, widely used core BioConductor flow cytometry infrastructure by allowing analysis to scale in a memory efficient manner to the large flow data sets that arise in clinical trials, and integrating domain-specific knowledge as part of the pipeline through the hierarchical relationships among cell populations. Pipelines are defined through a text-based csv file, limiting the need to write data-specific code, and are data agnostic to simplify repetitive analysis for core facilities. We demonstrate how to analyze two large cytometry data sets: an intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) data set from a published HIV vaccine trial focused on detecting rare, antigen-specific T-cell populations, where we identify a new subset of CD8 T-cells with a vaccine-regimen specific response that could not be identified through manual analysis, and a CyTOF T-cell phenotyping data set where a large staining panel and many cell populations are a challenge for traditional analysis. The substantial improvements to the core BioConductor flow cytometry packages give OpenCyto the potential for wide adoption. It can rapidly leverage new developments in computational cytometry and facilitate reproducible analysis in a unified environment.},

We retrospectively analyzed 324 patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated with front-line induction chemotherapy between October 2004 and March 2010. Fifty-six patients had FLT3-ITD mutation at diagnosis. Fifty-one (91{\%}) patients with FLT3-ITD achieved complete remission. Thirteen patients had FLT3 analysis at complete remission. None had FLT3-ITD. Twenty-five (49{\%}) patients with FLT3-ITD relapsed. Of these, 13 (52{\%}) had FLT3-ITD at relapse (3 negative and 9 not done). Among the 201 patients without FLT3-ITD at diagnosis who achieved complete remission, 77 (38{\%}) relapsed among whom 8 (10{\%}) patients acquired FLT3-ITD clone. We conclude that FLT3-ITD mutations are unstable at follow up and may occur for the first time at relapse. Therefore, FLT3-ITD is not a reliable marker for minimal residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia.},

abstract = {Responding to various stimuli is indispensable for the maintenance of homeostasis. The downregulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription is one of the mechanisms involved in the response to stimuli by various cellular processes, such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Cell differentiation is caused by intra- and extracellular stimuli and is associated with the downregulation of rRNA transcription as well as reduced cell growth. The downregulation of rRNA transcription during differentiation is considered to contribute to reduced cell growth. However, the downregulation of rRNA transcription can induce various cellular processes; therefore, it may positively regulate cell differentiation. To test this possibility, we specifically downregulated rRNA transcription using actinomycin D or a siRNA for Pol I-specific transcription factor IA (TIF-IA) in HL-60 and THP-1 cells, both of which have differentiation potential. The inhibition of rRNA transcription induced cell differentiation in both cell lines, which was demonstrated by the expression of the common differentiation marker CD11b. Furthermore, TIF-IA knockdown in an ex vivo culture of mouse hematopoietic stem cells increased the percentage of myeloid cells and reduced the percentage of immature cells. We also evaluated whether differentiation was induced via the inhibition of cell cycle progression because rRNA transcription is tightly coupled to cell growth. We found that cell cycle arrest without affecting rRNA transcription did not induce differentiation. To the best of our knowledge, our results demonstrate the first time that the downregulation of rRNA levels could be a trigger for the induction of differentiation in mammalian cells. Furthermore, this phenomenon was not simply a reflection of cell cycle arrest. Our results provide a novel insight into the relationship between rRNA transcription and cell differentiation.},

We also present a set of methods for annotating sequences deriving from known miRNAs, identifying variability in mature miRNA sequences, and identifying sequences belonging to previously unidentified miRNA genes. Application of this approach to RNA from human embryonic stem cells obtained before and after their differentiation into embryoid bodies revealed the sequences and expression levels of 334 known plus 104 novel miRNA genes. One hundred seventy-one known and 23 novel microRNA sequences exhibited significant expression differences between these two developmental states. Owing to the increased number of sequence reads, these libraries represent the deepest miRNA sampling to date, spanning nearly six orders of magnitude of expression. The predicted targets of those miRNAs enriched in either sample shared common features. Included among the high-ranked predicted gene targets are those implicated in differentiation, cell cycle control, programmed cell death, and transcriptional regulation.},

abstract = {The naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is a strictly subterranean, extraordinarily long-lived eusocial mammal. Although it is the size of a mouse, its maximum lifespan exceeds 30 years, making this animal the longest-living rodent. Naked mole rats show negligible senescence, no age-related increase in mortality, and high fecundity until death. In addition to delayed ageing, they are resistant to both spontaneous cancer and experimentally induced tumorigenesis. Naked mole rats pose a challenge to the theories that link ageing, cancer and redox homeostasis. Although characterized by significant oxidative stress, the naked mole rat proteome does not show age-related susceptibility to oxidative damage or increased ubiquitination. Naked mole rats naturally reside in large colonies with a single breeding female, the /`queen/', who suppresses the sexual maturity of her subordinates. They also live in full darkness, at low oxygen and high carbon dioxide concentrations, and are unable to sustain thermogenesis nor feel certain types of pain. Here we report the sequencing and analysis of the naked mole rat genome, which reveals unique genome features and molecular adaptations consistent with cancer resistance, poikilothermy, hairlessness and insensitivity to low oxygen, and altered visual function, circadian rythms and taste sensing. This information provides insights into the naked mole rat/'s exceptional longevity and ability to live in hostile conditions, in the dark and at low oxygen. The extreme traits of the naked mole rat, together with the reported genome and transcriptome information, offer opportunities for understanding ageing and advancing other areas of biological and biomedical research.},

abstract = {Being involved in many important biological processes, miRNAs can regulate gene expression by targeting mRNAs to facilitate their degradation or translational inhibition. Many miRNA sequencing studies reveal that miRNA variations such as isomiRs and “arm switching” are biologically relevant. However, existing standalone tools usually do not provide comprehensive, detailed information on miRNA variations. To deepen our understanding of miRNA variability, we developed a new standalone tool called “mirPRo” to quantify known miRNAs and predict novel miRNAs. Compared with the most widely used standalone program, miRDeep2, mirPRo offers several new functions including read cataloging based on genome annotation, optional seed region check, miRNA family expression quantification, isomiR identification and categorization, and “arm switching” detection. Our comparative data analyses using three datasets from mouse, human and chicken demonstrate that mirPRo is more accurate than miRDeep2 by avoiding over-counting of sequence reads and by implementing different approaches in adapter trimming, mapping and quantification. mirPRo is an open-source standalone program (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mirpro/).},

Mammalian DNA methylation plays an essential role in development. To date, only snapshots of different mouse and human cell types have been generated, providing a static view on DNA methylation. To enable monitoring of methylation status as it changes over time, we establish a reporter of genomic methylation (RGM) that relies on a minimal imprinted gene promoter driving a fluorescent protein. We show that insertion of RGM proximal to promoter-associated CpG islands reports the gain or loss of DNA methylation. We further utilized RGM to report endogenous methylation dynamics of non-coding regulatory elements, such as the pluripotency-specific super enhancers of Sox2 and miR290. Loci-specific DNA methylation changes and their correlation with transcription were visualized during cell-state transition following differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells and during reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency. RGM will allow the investigation of dynamic methylation changes during development and disease at single-cell resolution.},

abstract = {The DNA methylation inhibitor azacitidine (5-azacytidine) is used against myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, but drug resistance is an ongoing, intractable problem. To investigate resistance mechanisms, we generated two azacitidine-resistant cell lines, THP-1/AR and HL60/AR, and studied genetic disparities between them and their corresponding parental lines. In cells treated with azacitidine, significant mitotic variations were noted in parental cells which were absent in resistant cells, suggesting that resistance arises from negating azacitidine-mediated activation of apoptosis signaling and reestablishing G2/M checkpoint. Importantly, both resistant cell lines have common point mutations in the uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2) gene, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of the azacitidine activation pathway. Forced expression of mutated UCK2 in parental THP-1 cells abrogated azacitidine-induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of wild type UCK2 in resistant THP-1/AR cells restored sensitivity to azacitidine, implying that UCK2 gene mutations perturb azacitidine activation and advance azacitidine resistance. Our study provides new insights into azacitidine resistance and establishes models useful in developing effective strategies to overcome it.},

Using a combination of experimental and bioinformatics analyses in colorectal cancer cells, we demonstrate that low-dose 5-AZA-CdR targets colorectal cancer-initiating cells (CICs) by inducing viral mimicry. This is associated with induction of dsRNAs derived at least in part from endogenous retroviral elements, activation of the MDA5/MAVS RNA recognition pathway, and downstream activation of IRF7. Indeed, disruption of virus recognition pathways, by individually knocking down MDA5, MAVS, or IRF7, inhibits the ability of 5-AZA-CdR to target colorectal CICs and significantly decreases 5-AZA-CdR long-term growth effects. Moreover, transfection of dsRNA into CICs can mimic the effects of 5-AZA-CdR. Together, our results represent a major shift in understanding the anti-tumor mechanisms of DNA-demethylating agents and highlight the MDA5/MAVS/IRF7 pathway as a potentially druggable target against CICs.},

Genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation are two well-studied sources of allele-specific methylation (ASM), but recent research has indicated a more complex pattern in which genotypic variation can be associated with allelically-skewed DNA methylation in cis. Given the known heterogeneity of DNA methylation across tissues and cell types we explored inter- and intra-individual variation in ASM across several regions of the human brain and whole blood from multiple individuals. Consistent with previous studies, we find widespread ASM with {\textgreater} 4{\%} of the ∼220,000 loci interrogated showing evidence of allelically-skewed DNA methylation. We identify ASM flanking known imprinted regions, and show that ASM sites are enriched in DNase I hypersensitivity sites and often located in an extended genomic context of intermediate DNA methylation. We also detect examples of genotype-driven ASM, some of which are tissue-specific. These findings contribute to our understanding of the nature of differential DNA methylation across tissues and have important implications for genetic studies of complex disease. As a resource to the community, ASM patterns across each of the tissues studied are available in a searchable online database: http://epigenetics.essex.ac.uk/ASMBrainBlood.},

abstract = {Owing to the more recent positive results with the anti-CD33 immunotoxin gemtuzumab ozogamicin, therapy against acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) targeting CD33 holds many promises. Here, CD33 and CD123 expression on AML blasts was studied by flow cytometry in a cohort of 319 patients with detailed information on French–American–British/World Health Organization (FAB/WHO) classification, cytogenetics and molecular aberrations. AMLs of 87.8{\%} express CD33 and would therefore be targetable with anti-CD33 therapies. Additionally, 9.4{\%} of AMLs express CD123 without concomitant CD33 expression. Thus, nearly all AMLs could be either targeted via CD33 or CD123. Simultaneous presence of both antigens was observed in 69.5{\%} of patients. Most importantly, even AMLs with adverse cytogenetics express CD33 and CD123 levels comparable to those with favorable and intermediate subtypes. Some patient groups with unfavorable alterations, such as FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations, high FLT3-ITD mutant/wild-type ratios and monosomy 5 are even characterized by high expression of CD33 and CD123. In addition, blasts of patients with mutant nucleophosmin (NPM1) revealed significantly higher CD33 and CD123 expression pointing toward the possibility of minimal residual disease-guided interventions in mutated NPM1-positive AMLs. These results stimulate the development of novel concepts to redirect immune effector cells toward CD33- and CD123-expressing blasts using bi-specific antibodies or engineered T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors.},

Cellular reprogramming highlights the epigenetic plasticity of the somatic cell state. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerging roles in epigenetic regulation, but their potential functions in reprogramming cell fate have been largely unexplored. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the expression patterns of over 16,000 genes, including 437 lncRNAs, during defined stages of reprogramming to pluripotency. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) were used as an intuitive way to structure and interrogate transcriptome data at the single-cell level. Early molecular events during reprogramming involved the activation of Ras signaling pathways, along with hundreds of lncRNAs. Loss-of-function studies showed that activated lncRNAs can repress lineage-specific genes, while lncRNAs activated in multiple reprogramming cell types can regulate metabolic gene expression. Our findings demonstrate that reprogramming cells activate defined sets of functionally relevant lncRNAs and provide a resource to further investigate how dynamic changes in the transcriptome reprogram cell state.},

abstract = {The balanced turnover of collagen is necessary to maintain the mechanical strength of pelvic supportive connective tissues. Homeobox (HOX) A11 is a key transcriptional factor that controls collagen metabolism and homoeostasis in the uterosacral ligaments (USLs), and the deficient HOXA11 signalling may contribute to alterations in the biochemical strength of the USLs, leading to pelvic organ prolapse (POP). However, it is unknown how HOXA11 transcripts are regulated in the USLs. In this study, we found that microRNA (miRNA)-30d and 181a were overexpressed in women with POP, and their expression was inversely correlated with HOXA11 mRNA levels. The overexpression of miR-30d or 181a suppressed HOXA11 mRNA and protein levels in 293T cells, whereas the knockdown of these miRNAs enhanced HOXA11 levels and collagen production. Cotransfection of a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the 3′-untranslated region of HOXA11 with miR-30d or 181a mimic resulted in decreased relative luciferase activity. Conversely, cotransfection with anti-miR-30d or 181a increased luciferase activity. Taken together, these results indicate that both miR-30d and 181a are important posttranscriptional regulators of HOXA11 in the USLs and could be a potential therapeutic target for POP.},

Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.},

This assay measures the frequency in persons of blood type MN of variant erythrocytes that lack the expression of one allelic form of glycophorin A, presumably due to mutational or recombinational events in erythroid precursor cells. Samples of blood from persons with BS showed dramatic 50- to 100-fold increases in the frequency of variants of three types, those with a hemizygous phenotype, those with a homozygous phenotype, and those with what appears to be partial loss of the expression of one locus. The high frequency of homozygous variants, genetic evidence for altered allelic segregation of a specific biochemical locus, provides evidence for increased somatic crossing-over in vivo in BS. An increased generation of functional hemizygosity and homozygosity in their somatic cells may play an important role in the extreme cancer risk of persons with BS.},

Flow FISH analysis can be performed using commercially available flow cytometers, and has the unique advantage over other methods for measuring telomere length of providing multi-parameter information on the length of telomere repeats in thousands of individual cells. The accuracy and reproducibility of the measurements is augmented by the automation of most pipetting (aspiration and dispensing) steps, and by including an internal standard (control cells) with a known telomere length in every tube. The basic protocol for the analysis of nucleated blood cells from 22 different individuals takes about 12 h spread over 2–3 days.},

abstract = {Cytogenetic alterations, such as amplifications, deletions, or translocations, contribute to myeloid malignancies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of hematopoiesis, and their aberrant expression has been associated with leukemia. Genomic regions containing sequence alterations and fragile sites in cancers are enriched with miRNAs; however, the relevant miRNAs within these regions have not been evaluated on a global basis. Here, we investigated miRNAs relevant to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by (1) mapping miRNAs within leukemia-associated genomic alterations in human AML cell lines by high-resolution genome arrays and (2) evaluating absolute expression of these miRNAs by massively parallel small RNA sequencing. Seventy-seven percent (542 of 706) of miRNAs mapped to leukemia-associated copy-number alterations in the cell lines; however, only 18{\%} (99 of 542) of these miRNAs are expressed above background levels. As evidence that this subset of miRNAs is relevant to leukemia, we show that loss of 2 miRNAs identified in our analysis, miR-145 and miR-146a, results in leukemia in a mouse model. Small RNA sequencing identified 28 putative novel miRNAs, 18 of which map to leukemia-associated copy-number alterations. This detailed genomic and small RNA analysis points to a subset of miRNAs that may play a role in myeloid malignancies.},

abstract = {In a high throughput setting, effective flow cytometry data analysis depends heavily on proper data preprocessing. While usual preprocessing steps of quality assessment, outlier removal, normalization, and gating have received considerable scrutiny from the community, the influence of data transformation on the output of high throughput analysis has been largely overlooked. Flow cytometry measurements can vary over several orders of magnitude, cell populations can have variances that depend on their mean fluorescence intensities, and may exhibit heavily-skewed distributions. Consequently, the choice of data transformation can influence the output of automated gating. An appropriate data transformation aids in data visualization and gating of cell populations across the range of data. Experience shows that the choice of transformation is data specific. Our goal here is to compare the performance of different transformations applied to flow cytometry data in the context of automated gating in a high throughput, fully automated setting. We examine the most common transformations used in flow cytometry, including the generalized hyperbolic arcsine, biexponential, linlog, and generalized Box-Cox, all within the BioConductor flowCore framework that is widely used in high throughput, automated flow cytometry data analysis. All of these transformations have adjustable parameters whose effects upon the data are non-intuitive for most users. By making some modelling assumptions about the transformed data, we develop maximum likelihood criteria to optimize parameter choice for these different transformations.},

@article{Zhou2012a,
abstract = {With a dataset of more than 600 million small RNAs deeply sequenced from mouse hippocampal and staged sets of mouse cells that underwent reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells, we annotated the stem–loop precursors of the known miRNAs to identify isomoRs (miRNA-offset RNAs), loops, non-preferred strands, and guide strands. Products from both strands were readily detectable for most miRNAs. Changes in the dominant isomiR occurred among the cell types, as did switches of the preferred strand. The terminal nucleotide of the dominant isomiR aligned well with the dominant off-set sequence suggesting that Drosha cleavage generates most miRNA reads without terminal modification. Among the terminal modifications detected, most were non-templated mono- or di-nucleotide additions to the 3′-end. Based on the relative enrichment or depletion of specific nucleotide additions in an Ago-IP fraction there may be differential effects of these modifications on RISC loading. Sequence variation of the two strands at their cleavage sites suggested higher fidelity of Drosha than Dicer. These studies demonstrated multiple patterns of miRNA processing and considerable versatility in miRNA target selection.},

We show that large-scale CNVs cause proportional changes in RNA expression of genes within the gained or lost genomic regions, whereas these CNVs generally do not affect DNA methylation in these regions. Furthermore, we applied scTrio-seq to 25 single cancer cells derived from a human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue sample. We identified two subpopulations within these cells based on CNVs, DNA methylome, or transcriptome of individual cells. Our work offers a new avenue of dissecting the complex contribution of genomic and epigenomic heterogeneities to the transcriptomic heterogeneity within a population of cells.},

abstract = {Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) manifests as phenotypically and functionally diverse cells, often within the same patient. Intratumor phenotypic and functional heterogeneity have been linked primarily by physical sorting experiments, which assume that functionally distinct subpopulations can be prospectively isolated by surface phenotypes. This assumption has proven problematic, and we therefore developed a data-driven approach. Using mass cytometry, we profiled surface and intracellular signaling proteins simultaneously in millions of healthy and leukemic cells. We developed PhenoGraph, which algorithmically defines phenotypes in high-dimensional single-cell data. PhenoGraph revealed that the surface phenotypes of leukemic blasts do not necessarily reflect their intracellular state. Using hematopoietic progenitors, we defined a signaling-based measure of cellular phenotype, which led to isolation of a gene expression signature that was predictive of survival in independent cohorts. This study presents new methods for large-scale analysis of single-cell heterogeneity and demonstrates their utility, yielding insights into AML pathophysiology.},

abstract = {Chromosomal deletions are common molecular events in myeloid malignancies. Heterozygous deletions may contain a tumor suppressor gene that undergoes homozygous inactivation or may contain one or more genes that alter the disease phenotype through haploinsufficiency. The most common karyotypic abnormality in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is deletion of chromosome 5q. A subset of patients with del(5q) as a sole cytogenetic abnormality has a consistent set of clinical features, termed the 5q- syndrome. While no tumor suppressor genes have been identified on 5q that are homozygously inactivated, recent studies have highlighted several genes and micro RNAs (miRNAs) that cause the phenotype of the 5q- syndrome through allelic insufficiency. For example, deletion of one allele of the RPS14 gene causes a severe defect in erythropoiesis, analogous to the congenital syndrome Diamond Blackfan anemia, which is itself caused by mutations that inactivate one allele of a ribosomal gene. Loss of one allele of miR-145 and miR-146a causes an increase in megakaryocyte production and may contribute to the clonal advantage of cells with del(5q). The functional approaches used to dissect the molecular basis of the 5q deletion in MDS have the potential to identify key genes and therapeutic targets within other chromosomal deletions in hematologic malignancies.},

abstract = {Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) frequency is a commonly used index of chromosomal stability in response to environmental or genetic mutagens. However, the mechanism generating cytologically detectable SCEs and, therefore, their prognostic value for chromosomal stability in mitotic cells remain unclear. We examined the role of the highly conserved homologous recombination (HR) pathway in SCE by measuring SCE levels in HR-defective vertebrate cells. Spontaneous and mitomycin C-induced SCE levels were significantly reduced for chicken DT40 B cells lacking the key HR genes RAD51 and RAD54 but not for nonhomologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ)-defective KU70−/− cells. As measured by targeted integration efficiency, reconstitution of HR activity by expression of a human RAD51 transgene restored SCE levels to normal, confirming that HR is the mechanism responsible for SCE. Our findings show that HR uses the nascent sister chromatid to repair potentially lethal DNA lesions accompanying replication, which might explain the lethality or tumorigenic potential associated with defects in HR or HR-associated proteins.},

@article{Lampariello2000a,
abstract = {BACKGROUNDThe problem considered is the quantitative comparison of immunofluorescence frequency distributions in order to detect their differences of biological significance, i.e., to evaluate the potential positivity of a cell sample with respect to negative control cells. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistical test, proposed in the literature for this purpose, is examined and discussed through its application to a set of experimental measurements. It is shown that even differences due to the stain procedure or to instrumental biases may be considered significant by the test implemented in the standard form.METHODSIn order to ensure valid results, it is necessary to take into account the various sources of variation in the specific experimental context. A procedure is proposed that uses the KS statistics as a reference for determining an appropriate estimate of the overall variability in the control data. This estimate is derived from the comparisons of the cumulative distributions associated with repeated measurements of the negative cell sample.Results and Conclusions:The KS-related index thus defined provides a tool for assessing the potential positivity of a cell sample, since it allows to distinguish between statistical and biological significance of the difference between the histogram to be tested and the set of control data. In particular, if a cell sample is not included in the control variability, either a positive cell subpopulation is present, or all cells are positive. Instead, for a sample included in the control variability, the difference will be not biologically meaningful, even if statistically significant. Moreover, when a purely positive control sample is also available, it is possible to derive a measure of the precision at which a true biological positivity can be detected. Finally, since the index is not absolute, but relative to the features of the instrumentation, of the antibodies and of the fluorochromes used, it represents a quantitative measure of the stability and reproducibility of the measurement process and could be used for quality control of flow cytometric experiments in immunofluorescence.

abstract = {Summary
The transcriptional programs that govern hematopoiesis have been investigated primarily by population-level analysis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which cannot reveal the continuous nature of the differentiation process. Here we applied single-cell RNA-sequencing to a population of hematopoietic cells in zebrafish as they undergo thrombocyte lineage commitment. By reconstructing their developmental chronology computationally, we were able to place each cell along a continuum from stem cell to mature cell, refining the traditional lineage tree. The progression of cells along this continuum is characterized by a highly coordinated transcriptional program, displaying simultaneous suppression of genes involved in cell proliferation and ribosomal biogenesis as the expression of lineage specific genes increases. Within this program, there is substantial heterogeneity in the expression of the key lineage regulators. Overall, the total number of genes expressed, as well as the total mRNA content of the cell, decreases as the cells undergo lineage commitment.},

abstract = {CEBPA mutations have been associated with improved outcome in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We evaluated the prevalence and prognostic significance of CEBPA mutations in 847 children with AML treated on 3 consecutive pediatric trials. Two types of CEBPA mutations—N-terminal truncating mutations and in-frame bZip-domain mutations—were detected in 38 (4.5{\%}) of 847 patients tested; 31 (82{\%}) of 38 patients with mutations harbored both mutation types. Mutation status was correlated with laboratory and clinical characteristics and clinical outcome. CEBPA mutations were significantly more common in older patients, patients with FAB M1 or M2, and patients with normal karyotype. Mutations did not occur in patients with either favorable or unfavorable cytogenetics. Actuarial event-free survival at 5 years was 70{\%} versus 38{\%} (P = .015) with a cumulative incidence of relapse from complete remission of 13{\%} versus 44{\%} (P = .007) for those with and without CEBPA mutations. The presence of CEBPA mutations was an independent prognostic factor for improved outcome (HR = 0.24, P = .047). As CEBPA mutations are associated with lower relapse rate and improved survival, CEBPA mutation analysis needs to be incorporated into initial screening for risk identification and therapy allocation at diagnosis. The clinical trials in this study are registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov under NCT00002798 and NCT00070174.},

However, little is known regarding the biological function of TET2 and its role in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. To study the function of TET2 in vivo, we generated a Tet2 knock out mouse model. Deletion of Tet2 in mice led to dramatic reduction in the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels and concomitant increase in the 5-methylcytosine levels in the genomic DNA of BM cells. The Tet2−/− mice contained an increased Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cell pool before the development of myeloid malignancies. A competitive reconstitution assay revealed that Tet2−/− LSK cells had an increased hematopoietic repopulating capacity with an altered cell differentiation skewing toward monocytic/granulocytic lineages. Approximately 1/3 of Tet2−/− and 8{\%} of Tet2+/− mice died within 1 year of age because of the development of myeloid malignancies resembling characteristics of CMML, MPD-like myeloid leukemia, and MDS. Furthermore, transplantation of Tet2−/−, but not wild-type (WT) or Tet2+/− BM cells, led to increased WBC counts, monocytosis, and splenomegaly in WT recipient mice. These data indicate that Tet2-deficient mice recapitulate patients with myeloid malignancies, implying that Tet2 functions as a tumor suppressor to maintain hematopoietic cell homeostasis.},

abstract = {Summary
To analyze cellular reprogramming at the single-cell level, mass cytometry was used to simultaneously measure markers of pluripotency, differentiation, cell-cycle status, and cellular signaling throughout the reprogramming process. Time-resolved progression analysis of the resulting data sets was used to construct a continuous molecular roadmap for three independent reprogramming systems. Although these systems varied substantially in Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc stoichiometry, they presented a common set of reprogramming landmarks. Early in the reprogramming process, Oct4highKlf4high cells transitioned to a CD73highCD104highCD54low partially reprogrammed state. Ki67low cells from this intermediate population reverted to a MEF-like phenotype, but Ki67high cells advanced through the M-E-T and then bifurcated into two distinct populations: an ESC-like NanoghighSox2highCD54high population and a mesendoderm-like NanoglowSox2lowLin28highCD24highPDGFR-$\alpha$high population. The methods developed here for time-resolved, single-cell progression analysis may be used for the study of additional complex and dynamic systems, such as cancer progression and embryonic development.},

Here we present the validated EuroFlow 8-color antibody panels for immunophenotyping of hematological malignancies. The single-tube screening panels and multi-tube classification panels fit into the EuroFlow diagnostic algorithm with entries defined by clinical and laboratory parameters. The panels were constructed in 2–7 sequential design–evaluation–redesign rounds, using novel Infinicyt software tools for multivariate data analysis. Two groups of markers are combined in each 8-color tube: (i) backbone markers to identify distinct cell populations in a sample, and (ii) markers for characterization of specific cell populations. In multi-tube panels, the backbone markers were optimally placed at the same fluorochrome position in every tube, to provide identical multidimensional localization of the target cell population(s). The characterization markers were positioned according to the diagnostic utility of the combined markers. Each proposed antibody combination was tested against reference databases of normal and malignant cells from healthy subjects and WHO-based disease entities, respectively. The EuroFlow studies resulted in validated and flexible 8-color antibody panels for multidimensional identification and characterization of normal and aberrant cells, optimally suited for immunophenotypic screening and classification of hematological malignancies.},

Higher-risk eligible patients should be offered consultation to discuss hematopoietic stem cell transplantation close to the time of diagnosis, depending on patient goals of therapy, with consideration given to proceeding to transplantation soon after an optimal donor is located.

abstract = {We present single-cell clustering using bifurcation analysis (SCUBA), a novel computational method for extracting lineage relationships from single-cell gene expression data and modeling the dynamic changes associated with cell differentiation. SCUBA draws techniques from nonlinear dynamics and stochastic differential equation theories, providing a systematic framework for modeling complex processes involving multilineage specifications. By applying SCUBA to analyze two complementary, publicly available datasets we successfully reconstructed the cellular hierarchy during early development of mouse embryos, modeled the dynamic changes in gene expression patterns, and predicted the effects of perturbing key transcriptional regulators on inducing lineage biases. The results were robust with respect to experimental platform differences between RT-PCR and RNA sequencing. We selectively tested our predictions in Nanog mutants and found good agreement between SCUBA predictions and the experimental data. We further extended the utility of SCUBA by developing a method to reconstruct missing temporal-order information from a typical single-cell dataset. Analysis of a hematopoietic dataset suggests that our method is effective for reconstructing gene expression dynamics during human B-cell development. In summary, SCUBA provides a useful single-cell data analysis tool that is well-suited for the investigation of developmental processes.},

abstract = {DNA rearrangements such as sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) are sensitive indicators of genomic stress and instability, but they are typically masked by single-cell sequencing techniques. We developed Strand-seq to independently sequence parental DNA template strands from single cells, making it possible to map SCEs at orders-of-magnitude greater resolution than was previously possible. On average, murine embryonic stem (mES) cells exhibit eight SCEs, which are detected at a resolution of up to 23 bp. Strikingly, Strand-seq of 62 single mES cells predicts that the mm9 mouse reference genome assembly contains at least 17 incorrectly oriented segments totaling nearly 1{\%} of the genome. These misoriented contigs and fragments have persisted through several iterations of the mouse reference genome and have been difficult to detect using conventional sequencing techniques. The ability to map SCE events at high resolution and fine-tune reference genomes by Strand-seq dramatically expands the scope of single-cell sequencing.},

abstract = {Background and Objectives ACPA+ individuals with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms are at high risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We previously demonstrated dys-regulation of T-cell subsets with loss of na{\"{i}}ve and regulatory T-cells (Treg) in early disease. The aim of the current study is to demonstrate the predictive value of T-cell subset analysis for progression towards symptom onset in ACPA+ individuals.
Materials and Methods 84 ACPA+ individuals without clinical synovitis at recruitment were followed. 95 healthy controls (HC) provided a reference group. At baseline T-cell subset analyses were performed using 6-colour flowcytometry for na{\"{i}}ve T-cells (CD4+ CD45RB + CD45RA+ CD62L+), Treg (CD4+ CD25highFoxp3 + CD127low) and inflammation related cells (IRC: CD4+ CD45RB + CD45RA+ CD62L-). The relationship between na{\"{i}}ve cell frequency and age was established in HC and used to age-correct values in ACPA+ . ROC curve analysis was used to identify 2 T-cell cut-offs predicting progression to IA at any time; one which maximised the Youden index (sensitivity + specificity-1), and one which prioritised specificity over sensitivity.
Results 42/84 (50{\%}) of patients developed clinical synovitis within a median follow-up of 6.0 months (range 1 week-46 months). For age-corrected na{\"{i}}ve T-cells area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.67 (95{\%} CI 0.55, 0.79; n = 84, p = 0.007), for IRC 0.70 (0.59, 0.81; n = 81, p = 0.002) and for Treg 0.67 (0.53, 0.80; n = 65, p = 0.021). For each of the three subsets, the Youden index cut-off correctly classified {\textgreater}65{\%} of patients (Table 1). Cut-offs prioritising specificity were identified which did not greatly reduce overall classification success. The confidence intervals for these estimates remain wide and our sample size may still be limited for running such analysis. View this table: In this window In a new window

Conclusions T-cell dys-regulation in ACPA+ individuals with non-specific musculoskeletal pain may be useful in predicting progression to inflammatory arthritis. Multivariable modelling in larger cohorts is needed to quantify the utility of T-cell subsets in predicting progression to IA.},

One major difficulty in relevance feedback is to estimate the support of target images in high dimensional feature space with a relatively small number of training samples. We develop a novel scheme based on one-class SVM, which fits a tight hyper-sphere in the nonlinearly transformed feature space to include most of the target images based on positive examples. The use of a kernel provides us an elegant way to deal with nonlinearity in the distribution of the target images, while the regularization term in SVM provides good generalization ability. To validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, we test it on both synthesized data and real-world images. Promising results are achieved in both cases},

abstract = {Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) aims to help couples with heritable genetic disorders to avoid the birth of diseased offspring or the recurrence of loss of conception. Following in vitro fertilization, one or a few cells are biopsied from each human preimplantation embryo for genetic testing, allowing diagnosis and selection of healthy embryos for uterine transfer. Although classical methods, including single-cell PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization, enable PGD for many genetic disorders, they have limitations. They often require family-specific designs and can be labor intensive, resulting in long waiting lists. Furthermore, certain types of genetic anomalies are not easy to diagnose using these classical approaches, and healthy offspring carrying the parental mutant allele(s) can result. Recently, state-of-the-art methods for single-cell genomics have flourished, which may overcome the limitations associated with classical PGD, and these underpin the development of generic assays for PGD that enable selection of embryos not only for the familial genetic disorder in question, but also for various other genetic aberrations and traits at once. Here, we discuss the latest single-cell genomics methodologies based on DNA microarrays, single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays or next-generation sequence analysis. We focus on their strengths, their validation status, their weaknesses and the challenges for implementing them in PGD.

abstract = {Cell populations can be strikingly heterogeneous, composed of multiple cellular states, each exhibiting stochastic noise in its gene expression. A major challenge is to disentangle these two types of variability and to understand the dynamic processes and mechanisms that control them. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) provide an ideal model system to address this issue because they exhibit heterogeneous and dynamic expression of functionally important regulatory factors. We analyzed gene expression in individual ESCs using single-molecule RNA-FISH and quantitative time-lapse movies. These data discriminated stochastic switching between two coherent (correlated) gene expression states and burst-like transcriptional noise. We further showed that the “2i” signaling pathway inhibitors modulate both types of variation. Finally, we found that DNA methylation plays a key role in maintaining these metastable states. Together, these results show how ESC gene expression states and dynamics arise from a combination of intrinsic noise, coherent cellular states, and epigenetic regulation., • smFISH in ESCs reveals two transcriptional states and highly stochastic expression • Live-cell expression dynamics reveal the in situ transition rates between states • DNA methylation regulates state-switching dynamics • “2i” signaling inhibitors impact both gene expression noise and state transitions , Using single-molecule RNA-FISH and quantitative time-lapse movies, Singer et al. discriminate two primary sources of gene expression heterogeneity in embryonic stem cells: random switching between correlated gene expression states and burst-like transcriptional noise. Perturbing specific signaling pathways modulates both processes, and DNA methylation is key to maintaining these states.},

abstract = {Highly multiplexed, single-cell technologies reveal important heterogeneity within cell populations. Recently, technologies to simultaneously measure expression of 96 (or more) genes from a single cell have been developed for immunologic monitoring. Here, we report a rigorous, optimized, quantitative methodology for using this technology. Specifically: we describe a unique primer/probe qualification method necessary for quantitative results; we show that primers do not compete in highly multiplexed amplifications; we define the limit of detection for this assay as a single mRNA transcript; and, we show that the technical reproducibility of the system is very high. We illustrate two disparate applications of the platform: a “bulk” approach that measures expression patterns from 100 cells at a time in high throughput to define gene signatures, and a single-cell approach to define the coordinate expression patterns of multiple genes and reveal unique subsets of cells.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic mark that is required for normal development. Knockout of the DNA methyltransferase enzymes in the mouse hematopoietic compartment reveals that methylation is critical for hematopoietic differentiation. To better understand the role of DNA methylation in hematopoiesis, we characterized genome-wide DNA methylation in primary mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), and erythroblasts (ERYs). Methyl binding domain protein 2 (MBD) enrichment of DNA followed by massively parallel sequencing (MBD-seq) was used to map genome-wide DNA methylation. Globally, DNA methylation was most abundant in HSCs, with a 40{\%} reduction in CMPs, and a 67{\%} reduction in ERYs. Only 3{\%} of peaks arise during differentiation, demonstrating a genome-wide decline in DNA methylation during erythroid development. Analysis of genomic features revealed that 98{\%} of promoter CpG islands are hypomethylated, while 20{\%}–25{\%} of non-promoter CpG islands are methylated. Proximal promoter sequences of expressed genes are hypomethylated in all cell types, while gene body methylation positively correlates with gene expression in HSCs and CMPs. Elevated genome-wide DNA methylation in HSCs and the positive association between methylation and gene expression demonstrates that DNA methylation is a mark of cellular plasticity in HSCs. Using de novo motif discovery, we identified overrepresented transcription factor consensus binding motifs in methylated sequences. Motifs for several ETS transcription factors, including GABPA and ELF1, are overrepresented in methylated regions. Our genome-wide survey demonstrates that DNA methylation is markedly altered during myeloid differentiation and identifies critical regions of the genome and transcription factor programs that contribute to hematopoiesis.},

abstract = {Objective
Fractures can initiate an immune response that disturbs osteoblastic and osteoclastic cellular homeostasis through cytokine production and release. The aim of our study was to investigate $\gamma$/$\delta$ T cells, innate lymphocytes known to be involved in tissue repair, as potential cellular components of the osteoimmune system's response to an in vivo model of bone injury. The absence of such cells or their effector cytokines influences the fate of other responder cells in proliferation, differentiation, matrix production, and ultimate callus formation.
Methods
Tibia fractures were created in 60 $\gamma$/$\delta$ T cell–deficient mice (also called $\delta$ T cell receptor [TCR]–knockout mice) and 60 control C57BL/6 mice. Analysis included radiographs, basic histology, mechanical testing, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical localization of $\gamma$/$\delta$ TCR–positive subsets from control animals and of CD44 expression from both groups, as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the effector cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN$\gamma$), and IL-6.
Results
Animals deficient in $\gamma$/$\delta$ T cells demonstrated more mature histologic elements and quantitative increases in the expression of major bone (bone sialoprotein) and cartilage (type II collagen) matrix proteins and in the expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 at a critical reparative phase. Moreover, only $\gamma$/$\delta$ T cell–deficient animals had a decrease in the osteoprogenitor antiproliferative cytokines IL-6 and IFN$\gamma$ at the reparative phase. The result was improved stability at the repair site and an overall superior biomechanical strength in $\gamma$/$\delta$ T cell–deficient mice compared with controls.
Conclusion
The evidence for a role of $\gamma$/$\delta$ T cells in the context of skeletal injury demonstrates the importance of the immune system's effect on bone biology, which is relevant to the field of osteoimmunology, and offers a potential molecular platform from which to develop essential therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {Expression of microRNAs, a new class of noncoding RNAs that hybridize to target messenger RNA and regulate their translation into proteins, has been recently demonstrated to be altered in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Distinctive patterns of increased expression and/or silencing of multiple microRNAs (microRNA signatures) have been associated with specific cytogenetic and molecular subsets of AML. Changes in the expression of several microRNAs altered in AML have been shown to have functional relevance in leukemogenesis, with some microRNAs acting as oncogenes and others as tumor suppressors. Both microRNA signatures and a single microRNA (ie, miR-181a) have been shown to supply prognostic information complementing that gained from cytogenetics, gene mutations, and altered gene expression. Moreover, it has been demonstrated experimentally that antileukemic effects can be achieved by modulating microRNA expression by pharmacologic agents and/or increasing low endogenous levels of microRNAs with tumor suppressor function by synthetic microRNA oligonucleotides, or down-regulating high endogenous levels of leukemogenic microRNAs by antisense oligonucleotides (antagomirs). Therefore, it is reasonable to predict the development of novel microRNA-based therapeutic approaches in AML. We review herein results of current studies analyzing changes of microRNA expression in AML and discuss their potential biologic, diagnostic, and prognostic relevance.},

abstract = {Heterogeneity in sample composition is an inherent issue in many gene expression studies and, in many cases, should be taken into account in the downstream analysis to enable correct interpretation of the underlying biological processes. Typical examples are infectious diseases or immunology-related studies using blood samples, where, for example, the proportions of lymphocyte sub-populations are expected to vary between cases and controls.
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised learning technique that has been applied successfully in several fields, notably in bioinformatics where its ability to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional data such as gene expression microarrays has been demonstrated. Very recently, it has been applied to biomarker discovery and gene expression deconvolution in heterogeneous tissue samples.
Being essentially unsupervised, standard NMF methods are not guaranteed to find components corresponding to the cell types of interest in the sample, which may jeopardize the correct estimation of cell proportions. We have investigated the use of prior knowledge, in the form of a set of marker genes, to improve gene expression deconvolution with NMF algorithms. We found that this improves the consistency with which both cell type proportions and cell type gene expression signatures are estimated. The proposed method was tested on a microarray dataset consisting of pure cell types mixed in known proportions. Pearson correlation coefficients between true and estimated cell type proportions improved substantially (typically from about 0.5 to approximately 0.8) with the semi-supervised (marker-guided) versions of commonly used NMF algorithms. Furthermore known marker genes associated with each cell type were assigned to the correct cell type more frequently for the guided versions. We conclude that the use of marker genes improves the accuracy of gene expression deconvolution using NMF and suggest modifications to how the marker gene information is used that may lead to further improvements.},

abstract = {TET2 is mutated/deleted with high frequencies in multiple forms of myeloid malignancies including MDS, CMML, MPN, and AML. However, little is known regarding the biological function of TET2 and its role in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. To study the function of TET2 in vivo, we generated a Tet2 knock out mouse model. Deletion of Tet2 in mice led to dramatic reduction in the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels and concomitant increase in the 5-methylcytosine levels in the genomic DNA of BM cells. The Tet2−/− mice contained an increased Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cell pool before the development of myeloid malignancies. A competitive reconstitution assay revealed that Tet2−/− LSK cells had an increased hematopoietic repopulating capacity with an altered cell differentiation skewing toward monocytic/granulocytic lineages. Approximately 1/3 of Tet2−/− and 8{\%} of Tet2+/− mice died within 1 year of age because of the development of myeloid malignancies resembling characteristics of CMML, MPD-like myeloid leukemia, and MDS. Furthermore, transplantation of Tet2−/−, but not wild-type (WT) or Tet2+/− BM cells, led to increased WBC counts, monocytosis, and splenomegaly in WT recipient mice. These data indicate that Tet2-deficient mice recapitulate patients with myeloid malignancies, implying that Tet2 functions as a tumor suppressor to maintain hematopoietic cell homeostasis.},

We identified a defined set of differentiation-related genes that are methylated in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells but show pronounced DNA hypomethylation in monocytes and in granulocytes. In addition, by comparing hematopoietic progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood to hematopoietic progenitor cells from peripheral blood of adult donors we were also able to analyze age-related methylation changes in CD34+ cells. Interestingly, the methylation changes observed in older progenitor cells showed a bimodal pattern with hypomethylation of differentiation-associated genes and de novo methylation events resembling epigenetic mutations. Our results thus provide detailed insight into the methylation dynamics during differentiation and suggest that epigenetic changes contribute to hematopoietic progenitor cell aging.},

abstract = {While DNA methylation is usually thought to be symmetrical across both alleles, there are some notable exceptions. Genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation are two well-studied sources of allele-specific methylation (ASM), but recent research has indicated a more complex pattern in which genotypic variation can be associated with allelically-skewed DNA methylation in cis. Given the known heterogeneity of DNA methylation across tissues and cell types we explored inter- and intra-individual variation in ASM across several regions of the human brain and whole blood from multiple individuals. Consistent with previous studies, we find widespread ASM with {\textgreater} 4{\%} of the ∼220,000 loci interrogated showing evidence of allelically-skewed DNA methylation. We identify ASM flanking known imprinted regions, and show that ASM sites are enriched in DNase I hypersensitivity sites and often located in an extended genomic context of intermediate DNA methylation. We also detect examples of genotype-driven ASM, some of which are tissue-specific. These findings contribute to our understanding of the nature of differential DNA methylation across tissues and have important implications for genetic studies of complex disease. As a resource to the community, ASM patterns across each of the tissues studied are available in a searchable online database: http://epigenetics.essex.ac.uk/ASMBrainBlood.},

We examined expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) encoded on chromosome 5q as a possible cause of haploinsufficiency. We show that deletion of chromosome 5q correlates with loss of two miRNAs that are abundant in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), miR-145 and miR-146a, and we identify Toll–interleukin-1 receptor domain–containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) and tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor-6 (TRAF6) as respective targets of these miRNAs. TIRAP is known to lie upstream of TRAF6 in innate immune signaling. Knockdown of miR-145 and miR-146a together or enforced expression of TRAF6 in mouse HSPCs resulted in thrombocytosis, mild neutropenia and megakaryocytic dysplasia. A subset of mice transplanted with TRAF6-expressing marrow progressed either to marrow failure or acute myeloid leukemia. Thus, inappropriate activation of innate immune signals in HSPCs phenocopies several clinical features of 5q– syndrome.},

Furthermore, it was observed that the expression pattern of the miRNA (miR)-17-92 cluster differed between the two cell types, and the expression levels of the miR-200 family in ISK cells were markedly increased compared with those of HEC-1B cells. The present study therefore identified potential novel biomarkers, which may be useful in the differentiation between type I and type II endometrial cancer, and also revealed miRNA alterations that may be associated with endometrial cancer and its underlying pathogenic mechanisms.},

abstract = {Background and Aims
Genomic instability, as reflected in specific chromosomal aneuploidies and variation in the nuclear DNA content, is a defining feature of human carcinomas. It is solidly established that the degree of genomic instability influences clinical outcome. We have recently identified a 12-gene expression signature that discerned genomically stable from unstable breast carcinomas. This gene expression signature was also useful to predict, with high accuracy, the clinical course in independent multiple published breast cancer cohorts. From a biological point of view, this result confirmed the central role of genomic instability for a tumor's ability to adapt to external challenges and selective pressure and hence, for continued survival fitness. This in turn prompted us to investigate whether this genomic instability signature could also predict clinical outcome in other cancer types of epithelial origins, including colorectal tumors, non-small cell lung carcinomas, and ovarian cancer.

Results
The results show that the gene expression signature that defines genomic instability and poor outcome in breast cancer contributes significantly more accurate (P {\textless} 0.05; compared with random prediction) prognostic information in multiple cancer types independent of established clinical parameters. The 12-gene genomic instability signature stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct post-operative survival in three non-small cell lung cancer cohorts (n = 637) in Kaplan-Meir analyses (log-rank P {\textless} 0.05). It predicted recurrence in colon cancer patients (n = 92) with an overall accuracy greater than 69{\%} (P = 0.04) in cross-cohort validation. It quantified relapse-free survival in ovarian cancer (n = 124; log-rank P {\textless} 0.05). Functional pathway analysis revealed interactions between the 12 signature genes and well known cancer hallmarks.

Conclusion
The degree of genomic instability has diagnostic and prognostic implications. It is tempting to speculate that pursuing genomic instability therapeutically could provide entry points for a target that is unique to cancer cells.},

abstract = {Abstract Non random segregation of sister chromatids has been implicated to help specify daughter cell fate (the Silent Sister Hypothesis [1]) or to protect the genome of long-lived stem cells (the Immortal Strand Hypothesis [2]). The idea that sister chromatids are non-randomly segregated into specific daughter cells is only marginally supported by data in sporadic and often contradictory studies. As a result, the field has moved forward rather slowly. The advent of being able to directly label and differentiate sister chromatids in vivo using fluorescence in situ hybridization [3] was a significant advance for such studies. However, this approach is limited by the need for large tracks of unidirectional repeats on chromosomes and the reliance on quantitative imaging of fluorescent probes and rigorous statistical analysis to discern between the two competing hypotheses. A novel method called Strand-seq which uses next-generation sequencing to assay sister chromatid inheritance patterns independently for each chromosome [4] offers a comprehensive approach to test for non-random segregation. In addition Strand-seq enables studies on the deposition of chromatin marks in relation to DNA replication. This method is expected to help unify the field by testing previous claims of non-random segregation in an unbiased way in many model systems in vitro and in vivo.},

A class of small non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), has been widely studied in human cancers as crucial regulatory molecule. Recent studies indicate that a series of isomiRs can be yielded from a miRNA locus, and these physiological miRNA isoforms have versatile roles in miRNA biogenesis. Herein, we performed a comprehensive analysis of miRNAs at the miRNA and isomiR levels in BC using next-generation sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Abnormally expressed miRNA (miR-21, miR-221, miR-155, miR-30e and miR-25) and isomiR profiles could be obtained at the miRNA and isomiR levels, and similar biological roles could be detected. IsomiR expression profiles should be further concerned, and especially isomiRs are actual regulatory molecules in the miRNA–mRNA regulatory networks. The study provides a comprehensive expression analysis at the miRNA and isomiR levels in BC, which indicates biological roles of isomiRs.},

We also present a set of methods for annotating sequences deriving from known miRNAs, identifying variability in mature miRNA sequences, and identifying sequences belonging to previously unidentified miRNA genes. Application of this approach to RNA from human embryonic stem cells obtained before and after their differentiation into embryoid bodies revealed the sequences and expression levels of 334 known plus 104 novel miRNA genes. One hundred seventy-one known and 23 novel microRNA sequences exhibited significant expression differences between these two developmental states. Owing to the increased number of sequence reads, these libraries represent the deepest miRNA sampling to date, spanning nearly six orders of magnitude of expression. The predicted targets of those miRNAs enriched in either sample shared common features. Included among the high-ranked predicted gene targets are those implicated in differentiation, cell cycle control, programmed cell death, and transcriptional regulation.},

Germ cells are vital for transmitting genetic information from one generation to the next and for maintaining the continuation of species. Here, we analyze the transcriptome of human primordial germ cells (PGCs) from the migrating stage to the gonadal stage at single-cell and single-base resolutions. Human PGCs show unique transcription patterns involving the simultaneous expression of both pluripotency genes and germline-specific genes, with a subset of them displaying developmental-stage-specific features. Furthermore, we analyze the DNA methylome of human PGCs and find global demethylation of their genomes. Approximately 10 to 11 weeks after gestation, the PGCs are nearly devoid of any DNA methylation, with only 7.8{\%} and 6.0{\%} of the median methylation levels in male and female PGCs, respectively. Our work paves the way toward deciphering the complex epigenetic reprogramming of the germline with the aim of restoring totipotency in fertilized oocytes.},

Evidence has shown that single nucleotide polymorphism located in pre-miRNA or mature microRNA may modify various biological processes and affect the processing of carcinogenesis. Published results about the association between miR-146a rs2910164 G/C polymorphism and human gastric cancer susceptibility are inconclusive. The aim of this study was to acquire a more precise effect of the association between the miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism and gastric risk by meta-analysis.

Methods
Eligible genetic association studies were searched from PubMed, Web of Knowledge and Chinese Biomedicine Database on human subject. Quantitative data synthesis was conducted for the associations of miR-146a rs2910164 G/C polymorphism with susceptibility to gastric cancer.

Results
Nine eligible studies that included a total of 3,885 gastric cancer patients and 5,396 controls were identified in the present meta-analysis. The overall OR indicated a potential association between rs2910164 polymorphism and GC but the effect was not statistically significant (GG vs. CG/CC: OR = 1.076, 95{\%} CI 0.925-1.251, P = 0.342). When stratifying for population, the result showed that miR-146a rs2910164 GG genotype was associated with increased gastric cancer risk among Chinese in recessive model (GG vs. CG/CC: OR = 1.171, 95{\%} CI 1.050-1.306, P = 0.005). Besides, no significant difference was found in gender, smoking, location, metastasis of lymph node and Laur{\`{e}}n's classification.

The present meta-analysis suggests an increased risk between miR-146a rs2910164 GG genotype and gastric cancer susceptibility in Chinese based on published literatures.},

abstract = {Epigenetic modifications must underlie lineage-specific differentiation as terminally differentiated cells express tissue-specific genes, but their DNA sequence is unchanged. Haematopoiesis provides a well-defined model to study epigenetic modifications during cell-fate decisions, as multipotent progenitors (MPPs) differentiate into progressively restricted myeloid or lymphoid progenitors. Although DNA methylation is critical for myeloid versus lymphoid differentiation, as demonstrated by the myeloerythroid bias in Dnmt1 hypomorphs, a comprehensive DNA methylation map of haematopoietic progenitors, or of any multipotent/oligopotent lineage, does not exist. Here we examined 4.6 million CpG sites throughout the genome for MPPs, common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs), and thymocyte progenitors (DN1, DN2, DN3). Marked epigenetic plasticity accompanied both lymphoid and myeloid restriction. Myeloid commitment involved less global DNA methylation than lymphoid commitment, supported functionally by myeloid skewing of progenitors following treatment with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Differential DNA methylation correlated with gene expression more strongly at CpG island shores than CpG islands. Many examples of genes and pathways not previously known to be involved in choice between lymphoid/myeloid differentiation have been identified, such as Arl4c and Jdp2. Several transcription factors, including Meis1, were methylated and silenced during differentiation, indicating a role in maintaining an undifferentiated state. Additionally, epigenetic modification of modifiers of the epigenome seems to be important in haematopoietic differentiation. Our results directly demonstrate that modulation of DNA methylation occurs during lineage-specific differentiation and defines a comprehensive map of the methylation and transcriptional changes that accompany myeloid versus lymphoid fate decisions.},

In the past decade, deregulation of miRNAs (by expression and/or function) has been associated with the pathogenesis, progression and prognosis of different diseases, including leukemia. The number of discovered genes encoding miRNAs has risen exponentially in this period, but the numbers of miRNA-target genes discovered and validated lag far behind. Scientists have gained more in-depth knowledge of the basic mechanism of action of miRNAs, but the main challenge still remaining is the identification of direct targets of these important ‘micro-players', to understand how they fine-tune so many biological processes in both healthy and diseased tissue. Many technologies have been developed in the past few years, some with more potential than others, but all with their own pros and cons. Here, we review the most common and most potent computational and experimental approaches for miRNA-target gene discovery and discuss how the hunting of targets is challenging but possible by taking the experimental limitations in consideration and choosing the correct cellular context for identifying relevant target genes.},

abstract = {The heterogeneity of DNA methylation within a population of cells necessitates DNA methylome profiling at single-cell resolution. Recently, we developed a single-cell reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (scRRBS) technique in which we modified the original RRBS method by integrating all the experimental steps before PCR amplification into a single-tube reaction. These modifications enable scRRBS to provide digitized methylation information on ∼1 million CpG sites within an individual diploid mouse or human cell at single-base resolution. Compared with the single-cell bisulfite sequencing (scBS) technique, scRRBS covers fewer CpG sites, but it provides better coverage for CpG islands (CGIs), which are likely to be the most informative elements for DNA methylation. The entire procedure takes ∼3 weeks, and it requires strong molecular biology skills.},

@article{Frohling2002a,
abstract = {PURPOSE: To prospectively compare cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic analysis for the detection of the most relevant chromosome abnormalities in a large series of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred forty consecutive adult patients with AML entered onto the multicenter treatment trial AML HD93 were studied. Chromosome banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) applying a comprehensive set of genomic DNA probes were performed in a single reference laboratory.
RESULTS: Two cases of inv(16), three cases of t(11q23), and three cases of t(8;21)var were only detected by molecular cytogenetics. By FISH, aberrations were identified in three cases with normal karyotypes: inv(16), −Y (in a patient with low metaphase yield on chromosome banding) and a 12p microdeletion. Additional aneuploidies, in particular +8q and +11q, were diagnosed by FISH; however, virtually all these aberrations occurred in patients with complex karyotypes or as an additional abnormality in leukemias with an AML-specific translocation. Finally, aberrations were detected by FISH in eight of 14 patients with no assessable metaphases.
CONCLUSION: In most cases of AML, conventional cytogenetic study reliably detects chromosomal abnormalities, and this method should not be replaced by FISH. FISH should be used as a complementary method for the detection of more subtle abnormalities, such as inv(16) and t(11q23), in all patients with newly diagnosed AML and for suspected t(8;21)var. Furthermore, molecular cytogenetics using this comprehensive set of DNA probes provides a valuable diagnostic tool for patients with poor chromosome morphology, low or no yields of metaphase cells, or both.},

@article{Bagwell2005,
abstract = {BackgroundThe remarkable success of cytometry over the past 30 years is largely due to its uncanny ability to display populations that vastly differ in numbers and fluorescence intensities on one scale. The log transform implemented in hardware as a log amplifier or in software normalizes signals or channels so that these populations appear as clearly discernible peaks. With the advent of multiple fluorescence cytometry, spectral crossover compensation of these signals has been necessary to properly interpret the data. Unfortunately, because compensation is a subtractive process, it can produce negative and zero valued data. The log transform is undefined for these values and, as a result, forces computer algorithms to truncate these values, creating a few problems for cytometrists. Data truncation biases displays making properly compensated data appear undercompensated; thus, enticing many operators to overcompensate their data. Also, events truncated into the first histogram channel are not normally visible with typical two-dimensional graphic displays, thus hiding a large number of events and obscuring the true proportionality of negative distributions. In addition, the log transform creates unequal binning that can dramatically distort negative population distributions.Methods and ResultsThe HyperLog transform is a log-like transform that admits negative, zero, and positive values. The transform is a hybrid type of transform specifically designed for compensated data. One of its parameters allows it to smoothly transition from a logarithmic to linear type of transform that is ideal for compensated data.ConclusionsThe HyperLog transform is easily implemented in computer systems and results in display systems that present compensated data in an unbiased manner. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

However, high frequencies of aneuploidy have been reported to occur naturally in the mammalian liver and brain, fueling speculation that aneuploidy provides a selective advantage in these organs. To explore this paradox, we used single cell sequencing to obtain a genome-wide, high-resolution assessment of chromosome copy number alterations in mouse and human tissues. We find that aneuploidy occurs much less frequently in the liver and brain than previously reported and is no more prevalent in these tissues than in skin. Our results highlight the rarity of chromosome copy number alterations across mammalian tissues and argue against a positive role for aneuploidy in organ function. Cancer is therefore the only known example, in mammals, of altering karyotype for functional adaptation.},

Modern high-throughput technologies enable deep sequencing of such RNA species on an unprecedented scale. We find that the analysis of small RNA deep-sequencing libraries can be affected by cross-mapping, in which RNA sequences originating from one locus are inadvertently mapped to another. Similar to cross-hybridization on microarrays, cross-mapping is prevalent among miRNAs, as they tend to occur in families, are similar or derived from repeat or structural RNAs, or are post-transcriptionally modified. Here, we develop a strategy to correct for cross-mapping, and apply it to the analysis of RNA editing in mature miRNAs. In contrast to previous reports, our analysis suggests that RNA editing in mature miRNAs is rare in animals.},

Our probabilistic method incorporates knowledge about the distribution of variants in terms of a prior probability. We show that our algorithm has a high accuracy of calling cancer mutations and demonstrate that the detected clonal and subclonal variants have important prognostic consequences.

A mature web tool for rapid and reliable display of any requested portion of the genome at any scale, together with several dozen aligned annotation tracks, is provided athttp://genome.ucsc.edu. This browser displays assembly contigs and gaps, mRNA and expressed sequence tag alignments, multiple gene predictions, cross-species homologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms, sequence-tagged sites, radiation hybrid data, transposon repeats, and more as a stack of coregistered tracks. Text and sequence-based searches provide quick and precise access to any region of specific interest. Secondary links from individual features lead to sequence details and supplementary off-site databases. One-half of the annotation tracks are computed at the University of California, Santa Cruz from publicly available sequence data; collaborators worldwide provide the rest. Users can stably add their own custom tracks to the browser for educational or research purposes. The conceptual and technical framework of the browser, its underlying MYSQL database, and overall use are described.

from human blood cells labeled with FITC-conjugated anti-CD3, PE-conjugated
anti-CD8, PE-Cy5-conjugated anti-CD4, and APC-conjugated anti-CD19
Abs was acquired on a FACSCalibur. Cells from four murine cell lines,
JAWS II, RAW 264.7, CTLL-2, and A20, were also stained with FITC-conjugated
anti-CD11c, PE-conjugated anti-CD11b, PE-Cy5-conjugated anti-CD8a,
and PE-Cy7-conjugated-CD45R/B220 Abs, respectively, and single color
flow data were collected on an LSRII. The data were fitted with a
mixture of multivariate Gaussians using standard Bayesian statistical
approaches and Markov chain Monte Carlo computations. Statistical
mixture models were able to identify and purify major cell subsets
in human peripheral blood, using an automated process that can be
generalized to an arbitrary number of markers. Validation against
both traditional expert gating and synthetic mixtures of murine cell

abstract = {Acute myeloid leukemia is a highly malignant hematopoietic tumor that affects about 13,000 adults yearly in the United States. The treatment of this disease has changed little in the past two decades, since most of the genetic events that initiate the disease remain undiscovered. Whole genome sequencing is now possible at a reasonable cost and timeframe to utilize this approach for unbiased discovery of tumor-specific somatic mutations that alter the protein-coding genes. Here we show the results obtained by sequencing a typical acute myeloid leukemia genome and its matched normal counterpart, obtained from the patient's skin. We discovered 10 genes with acquired mutations; two were previously described mutations thought to contribute to tumor progression, and 8 were novel mutations present in virtually all tumor cells at presentation and relapse, whose function is not yet known. Our study establishes whole genome sequencing as an unbiased method for discovering initiating mutations in cancer genomes, and for identifying novel genes that may respond to targeted therapies., We used massively parallel sequencing technology to sequence the genomic DNA of tumor and normal skin cells obtained from a patient with a typical presentation of FAB M1 Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) with normal cytogenetics. 32.7-fold ‘haploid' coverage (98 billion bases) was obtained for the tumor genome, and 13.9-fold coverage (41.8 billion bases) was obtained for the normal sample. Of 2,647,695 well-supported Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) found in the tumor genome, 2,588,486 (97.7{\%}) also were detected in the patient's skin genome, limiting the number of variants that required further study. For the purposes of this initial study, we restricted our downstream analysis to the coding sequences of annotated genes: we found only eight heterozygous, non-synonymous somatic SNVs in the entire genome. All were novel, including mutations in protocadherin/cadherin family members (CDH24 and PCLKC), G-protein coupled receptors (GPR123 and EBI2), a protein phosphatase (PTPRT), a potential guanine nucleotide exchange factor (KNDC1), a peptide/drug transporter (SLC15A1), and a glutamate receptor gene (GRINL1B). We also detected previously described, recurrent somatic insertions in the FLT3 and NPM1 genes. Based on deep readcount data, we determined that all of these mutations (except FLT3) were present in nearly all tumor cells at presentation, and again at relapse 11 months later, suggesting that the patient had a single dominant clone containing all of the mutations. These results demonstrate the power of whole genome sequencing to discover novel cancer-associated mutations.},

abstract = {Aims Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) exhibit clinical efficacy in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN). This study was performed to assess residual disease status by flow cytometry immunophenotyping (FCI) methods in patients with MDS or MDS/MPN treated with HMAs, and correlate the findings with clinical response.
Methods CD34+ myeloid precursors were assessed in 85 patients with MDS and MDS/MPN treated with HMAs using FCI methods. Morphological, cytogenetic and molecular assessments were performed to evaluate the responses.
Results After a median six cycles (3–19) of HMAs, 40 (47{\%}) patients showed haematological improvement, 26 (63{\%}) showed bone marrow (BM) and 20 (39{\%}) cytogenetic response. However, CD34+ myeloid progenitors showed persistent immunophenotypic aberrancies in 72 (85{\%}) patients, indeterminate in four (5{\%}) and negative in nine (10{\%}). Compared with pretreatment BM in a given patient, FCI abnormalities were reduced in 15 (20{\%}) patients, similar in 37 (48{\%}), increased in 15 (20{\%}) and showed antigenic shift in nine (12{\%}). Patients who achieved immunophenotypic improvement had a superior progression-free survival (p=0.031). In the subgroup of patients who underwent haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), 16/19 (84{\%}) patients who had a pre-HSCT positive FCI study became normal.
Conclusions These findings show the difficulty in eradicating neoplastic myeloid precursors by HMA therapy, thereby resulting in ultimate treatment failure in most patients. Achieving immunophenotypic improvement helps to identify patients who may benefit from continuous HMA treatment. HSCT provides a potential cure for these patients by replenishing BM with normal haematopoietic stem cells.},

In tumours, where genetic heterogeneity is common, very important information may be lost that would be useful for reconstructing evolutionary history. Here we show that with flow-sorted nuclei, whole genome amplification and next generation sequencing we can accurately quantify genomic copy number within an individual nucleus. We apply single-nucleus sequencing to investigate tumour population structure and evolution in two human breast cancer cases. Analysis of 100 single cells from a polygenomic tumour revealed three distinct clonal subpopulations that probably represent sequential clonal expansions. Additional analysis of 100 single cells from a monogenomic primary tumour and its liver metastasis indicated that a single clonal expansion formed the primary tumour and seeded the metastasis. In both primary tumours, we also identified an unexpectedly abundant subpopulation of genetically diverse ‘pseudodiploid' cells that do not travel to the metastatic site. In contrast to gradual models of tumour progression, our data indicate that tumours grow by punctuated clonal expansions with few persistent intermediates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Changes in environmental conditions lead to expression variation that manifest at the level of gene regulatory networks. Despite a strong understanding of the role noise plays in synthetic biological systems, it remains unclear how propagation of expression heterogeneity in an endogenous regulatory network is distributed and utilized by cells transitioning through a key developmental event. RESULTS: Here we investigate the temporal dynamics of a single-cell transcriptional network of 45 transcription factors in THP-1 human myeloid monocytic leukemia cells undergoing differentiation to macrophages. We systematically measure temporal regulation of expression and variation by profiling 120 single cells at eight distinct time points, and infer highly controlled regulatory modules through which signaling operates with stochastic effects. This reveals dynamic and specific rewiring as a cellular strategy for differentiation. The integration of both positive and negative co-expression networks further identifies the proto-oncogene MYB as a network hinge to modulate both the pro- and anti-differentiation pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to averaged cell populations, temporal single-cell expression profiling provides a much more powerful technique to probe for mechanistic insights underlying cellular differentiation. We believe that our approach will form the basis of novel strategies to study the regulation of transcription at a single-cell level.},

However, scaffolds are highly prone to errors, especially when generated using short reads, which can directly result in inflated assembly statistics.

In this review we focus on recent progress in analyzing the functional role of miR-146a in the control of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. On the other hand, this miRNA has shown to impact in the control of innate immune responses. Finally, many recent studies indicate a deregulation of miR-146 in many solid tumors and gene knockout studies indicate a role for this miRNA as a tumor suppressor.

abstract = {Motivation: Many practical pattern recognition problems require non-negativity constraints. For example, pixels in digital images and chemical concentrations in bioinformatics are non-negative. Sparse non-negative matrix factorizations (NMFs) are useful when the degree of sparseness in the non-negative basis matrix or the non-negative coefficient matrix in an NMF needs to be controlled in approximating high-dimensional data in a lower dimensional space.
Results: In this article, we introduce a novel formulation of sparse NMF and show how the new formulation leads to a convergent sparse NMF algorithm via alternating non-negativity-constrained least squares. We apply our sparse NMF algorithm to cancer-class discovery and gene expression data analysis and offer biological analysis of the results obtained. Our experimental results illustrate that the proposed sparse NMF algorithm often achieves better clustering performance with shorter computing time compared to other existing NMF algorithms.

abstract = {Quantitative analysis of epigenetic memory
To explore quantitative and dynamic properties of transcriptional regulation by epigenetic modifications, Bintu et al. monitored a transcriptional reporter gene carried on a human artificial chromosome in Chinese hamster ovary cells (see the Perspective by Keung and Khalil). They measured effects of DNA methylation and histone modifications by methylation or deacetylation in single cells using time-lapse microscopy. Silencing was an all-or-none, stochastic event, so graded adjustments to transcription occurred from changes in the proportion of cells that responded. Furthermore, the duration of recruitment of the chromatin regulators determined the fraction of cells that were silenced. Thus, distinct modifiers can produce different characteristics of epigenetic memory.
Science, this issue p. 720; see also p. 661
Chromatin regulators play a major role in establishing and maintaining gene expression states. Yet how they control gene expression in single cells, quantitatively and over time, remains unclear. We used time-lapse microscopy to analyze the dynamic effects of four silencers associated with diverse modifications: DNA methylation, histone deacetylation, and histone methylation. For all regulators, silencing and reactivation occurred in all-or-none events, enabling the regulators to modulate the fraction of cells silenced rather than the amount of gene expression. These dynamics could be described by a three-state model involving stochastic transitions between active, reversibly silent, and irreversibly silent states. Through their individual transition rates, these regulators operate over different time scales and generate distinct types of epigenetic memory. Our results provide a framework for understanding and engineering mammalian chromatin regulation and epigenetic memory.

The 6th Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM6) invited the research community to develop solutions to a computational challenge: classifying acute myeloid leukemia (AML) positive patients and healthy donors using flow cytometry data. DREAM6 provided flow cytometry data for 359 normal and AML samples, and the class labels for half of the samples. Researchers were asked to predict the class labels of the remaining half. This paper describes one solution that was constructed by combining three algorithms: spanning-tree progression analysis of density-normalized events (SPADE), earth mover's distance, and a nearest-neighbor classifier called Relief.

abstract = {Summary
Within the bone marrow, stem cells differentiate and give rise to diverse blood cell types and functions. Currently, hematopoietic progenitors are defined using surface markers combined with functional assays that are not directly linked with in vivo differentiation potential or gene regulatory mechanisms. Here, we comprehensively map myeloid progenitor subpopulations by transcriptional sorting of single cells from the bone marrow. We describe multiple progenitor subgroups, showing unexpected transcriptional priming toward seven differentiation fates but no progenitors with a mixed state. Transcriptional differentiation is correlated with combinations of known and previously undefined transcription factors, suggesting that the process is tightly regulated. Histone maps and knockout assays are consistent with early transcriptional priming, while traditional transplantation experiments suggest that in vivo priming may still allow for plasticity given strong perturbations. These data establish a reference model and general framework for studying hematopoiesis at single-cell resolution.},

The median age at presentation for patients with AML is 70 years. In the past few years, research in molecular biology has been instrumental in deciphering the pathogenesis of the disease. Genetic defects are thought to be the most important factors in determining the response to chemotherapy and outcome. Whereas significant progress has been made in the treatment of younger adults, the prospects for elderly patients have remained dismal, with median survival times of only a few months. This difference is related to comorbidities associated with ageing and to disease biology. Current efforts in clinical research focus on the assessment of targeted therapies.

Here we use HITS-CLIP to covalently crosslink native argonaute (Ago, also called Eif2c) protein–RNA complexes in mouse brain. This produced two simultaneous data sets—Ago–miRNA and Ago–mRNA binding sites—that were combined with bioinformatic analysis to identify interaction sites between miRNA and target mRNA. We validated genome-wide interaction maps for miR-124, and generated additional maps for the 20 most abundant miRNAs present in P13 mouse brain.

abstract = {Background:In immunofluorescence measurements and most other flow cytometry applications, fluorescence signals of interest can range down to essentially zero. After fluorescence compensation, some cell populations will have low means and include events with negative data values. Logarithmic presentation has been very useful in providing informative displays of wide-ranging flow cytometry data, but it fails to adequately display cell populations with low means and high variances and, in particular, offers no way to include negative data values. This has led to a great deal of difficulty in interpreting and understanding flow cytometry data, has often resulted in incorrect delineation of cell populations, and has led many people to question the correctness of compensation computations that were, in fact, correct.Results:We identified a set of criteria for creating data visualization methods that accommodate the scaling difficulties presented by flow cytometry data. On the basis of these, we developed a new data visualization method that provides important advantages over linear or logarithmic scaling for display of flow cytometry data, a scaling we refer to as “Logicle” scaling. Logicle functions represent a particular generalization of the hyperbolic sine function with one more adjustable parameter than linear or logarithmic functions. Finally, we developed methods for objectively and automatically selecting an appropriate value for this parameter.Conclusions:The Logicle display method provides more complete, appropriate, and readily interpretable representations of data that includes populations with low-to-zero means, including distributions resulting from fluorescence compensation procedures, than can be produced using either logarithmic or linear displays. The method includes a specific algorithm for evaluating actual data distributions and deriving parameters of the Logicle scaling function appropriate for optimal display of that data. It is critical to note that Logicle visualization does not change the data values or the descriptive statistics computed from them. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Society for Analytical Cytology},

In this study, we sought to assess the contribution of the different analytical steps involved in the analysis of RNA-seq data generated with the Illumina platform, and to perform a cross-platform comparison based on the results obtained through Affymetrix microarray. As a case study for our work we, used the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CEN.PK 113-7D, grown under two different conditions (batch and chemostat). Here, we asses the influence of genetic variation on the estimation of gene expression level using three different aligners for read-mapping (Gsnap, Stampy and TopHat) on S288c genome, the capabilities of five different statistical methods to detect differential gene expression (baySeq, Cuffdiff, DESeq, edgeR and NOISeq) and we explored the consistency between RNA-seq analysis using reference genome and de novo assembly approach. High reproducibility among biological replicates (correlation ≥0.99) and high consistency between the two platforms for analysis of gene expression levels (correlation ≥0.91) are reported. The results from differential gene expression identification derived from the different statistical methods, as well as their integrated analysis results based on gene ontology annotation are in good agreement.

abstract = {The difficulty in maintaining the reconstituting capabilities of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in culture outside of the bone marrow microenvironment has severely limited their utilization for clinical therapy. This is largely due to the differentiation of long-term stem cells. Emerging evidence suggests that energy metabolism plays an important role in coordinating HSC self-renewal and differentiation. Here, we show that treatment with alexidine dihydrochloride, an antibiotic and a selective inhibitor of the mitochondrial phosphatase Ptpmt1, which is crucial for the differentiation of HSCs, reprogrammed cellular metabolism from mitochondrial aerobic metabolism to glycolysis, resulting in a remarkable preservation of long-term HSCs ex vivo in part through hyperactivation of AMPK kinase. In addition, inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism and activation of AMPK by metformin, an anti-diabetic drug, also decreased differentiation and helped maintain stem cells in culture. Thus, manipulating metabolic pathways represents an effective new strategy for ex vivo maintenance of HSCs.},

abstract = {Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in gene regulation. Although it is well known that multiple miRNAs may work as miRNA modules to synergistically regulate common target mRNAs, the understanding of miRNA modules is still in its infancy., Results: We employed the recently generated high throughput experimental data to study miRNA modules. We predicted 181 miRNA modules and 306 potential miRNA modules. We observed that the target sites of these predicted modules were in general weaker compared with those not bound by miRNA modules. We also discovered that miRNAs in predicted modules preferred to bind unconventional target sites rather than canonical sites. Surprisingly, contrary to a previous study, we found that most adjacent miRNA target sites from the same miRNA modules were not within the range of 10–130 nucleotides. Interestingly, the distance of target sites bound by miRNAs in the same modules was shorter when miRNA modules bound unconventional instead of canonical sites. Our study shed new light on miRNA binding and miRNA target sites, which will likely advance our understanding of miRNA regulation., Availability and implementation: The software miRModule can be freely downloaded at http://hulab.ucf.edu/research/projects/miRNA/miRModule., Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online., Contact: haihu@cs.ucf.edu or xiaoman@mail.ucf.edu.},

Multiple rounds exponentially enrich the population for the highest affinity species that can be clonally isolated and characterized. In particular one eight-base region of an RNA that interacts with the T4 DNA polymerase was chosen and randomized. Two different sequences were selected by this procedure from the calculated pool of 65,536 species. One is the wild-type sequence found in the bacteriophage mRNA; one is varied from wild type at four positions. The binding constants of these two RNA's to T4 DNA polymerase are equivalent. These protocols with minimal modification can yield high-affinity ligands for any protein that binds nucleic acids as part of its function; high-affinity ligands could conceivably be developed for any target molecule.},

abstract = {Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) exhibit similar but distinct immunophenotypic profiles. Many cases can be diagnosed readily by flow cytometry (FCM) alone; however, ambiguous cases are frequently encountered and necessitate additional studies, including immunohistochemical staining for cyclin D1 and fluorescence in situ hybridization for IgH-CCND1 rearrangement. To determine if greater diagnostic accuracy could be achieved from FCM data alone, we developed an unbiased, machine-based algorithm to identify features that best distinguish between the 2 diseases. By applying conventional diagnostic criteria to the flow cytometry data, we were able to assign 28 of 44 (64{\%}) MCL and 48 of 70 (69{\%}) SLL cases correctly. In contrast, we were able to assign all 44 (100{\%}) MCL and 68 of 70 (97{\%}) SLL cases correctly using a novel set of criteria, as identified by our automated approach. The most discriminating feature was the CD20/CD23 mean fluorescence intensity ratio, and we found unexpectedly that inclusion of FMC7 expression in the diagnostic algorithm actually reduced its accuracy. This study demonstrates that computational methods can be used on existing clinical FCM data to improve diagnostic accuracy and suggests similar computational approaches could be used to identify novel prognostic markers and perhaps subdivide existing or define new diagnostic entities.},

abstract = {About 40{\%} of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) present with a normal karyotype, and they are facing different courses of disease. To advance the biological understanding and to find molecular prognostic markers, we performed a high-resolution oligonucleotide array study of 107 MDS patients (French American British) with a normal karyotype and clinical follow-up through the Duesseldorf MDS registry. Recurrent hidden deletions overlapping with known cytogenetic aberrations or sites of known tumor-associated genes were identified in 4q24 (TET2, 2x), 5q31.2 (2x), 7q22.1 (3x) and 21q22.12 (RUNX1, 2x). One patient with a 7q22.1 deletion had an additional 5q31.2 deletion of the acute myeloid leukemia/MDS region, the smallest deletion identified so far and including the putative tumor suppressor (ts) genes, EGR1 and CTNNA1. One TET2 deletion was homozygous and one heterozygous, with a missense mutation in the remaining allele, further supporting its role as a ts gene. Besides these recurrent alterations, additional individual imbalances were found in 34 cases; in total, 42/107 (39{\%}) cases had genomic imbalances. These patients had an inferior survival as compared with the rest of the patients (P=0.002). This study emphasizes the heterogeneity of MDS, but points to interesting genes that may have diagnostic and prognostic impact.},

abstract = {Motivation: Many practical pattern recognition problems require non-negativity constraints. For example, pixels in digital images and chemical concentrations in bioinformatics are non-negative. Sparse non-negative matrix factorizations (NMFs) are useful when the degree of sparseness in the non-negative basis matrix or the non-negative coefficient matrix in an NMF needs to be controlled in approximating high-dimensional data in a lower dimensional space.
Results: In this article, we introduce a novel formulation of sparse NMF and show how the new formulation leads to a convergent sparse NMF algorithm via alternating non-negativity-constrained least squares. We apply our sparse NMF algorithm to cancer-class discovery and gene expression data analysis and offer biological analysis of the results obtained. Our experimental results illustrate that the proposed sparse NMF algorithm often achieves better clustering performance with shorter computing time compared to other existing NMF algorithms.

abstract = {While new sequencing technologies have ushered in an era where microbial genomes can be easily sequenced, the goal of routinely producing high-quality draft and finished genomes in a cost-effective fashion has still remained elusive. Due to shorter read lengths and limitations in library construction protocols, shotgun sequencing and assembly based on these technologies often results in fragmented assemblies. Correspondingly, while draft assemblies can be obtained in days, finishing can take many months and hence the time and effort can only be justified for high-priority genomes and in large sequencing centers. In this work, we revisit this issue in light of our own experience in producing finished and nearly-finished genomes for a range of microbial species in a small-lab setting. These genomes were finished with surprisingly little investments in terms of time, computational effort and lab work, suggesting that the increased access to sequencing might also eventually lead to a greater proportion of finished genomes from small labs and genomics cores.

abstract = {DNA methylation is a mechanism of epigenetic regulation that is common to all vertebrates. Functional studies underscore its relevance for tissue homeostasis, but the global dynamics of DNA methylation during in vivo differentiation remain underexplored. Here we report high-resolution DNA methylation maps of adult stem cell differentiation in mouse, focusing on 19 purified cell populations of the blood and skin lineages. DNA methylation changes were locus specific and relatively modest in magnitude. They frequently overlapped with lineage-associated transcription factors and their binding sites, suggesting that DNA methylation may protect cells from aberrant transcription factor activation. DNA methylation and gene expression provided complementary information, and combining the two enabled us to infer the cellular differentiation hierarchy of the blood lineage directly from genome-scale data. In summary, these results demonstrate that in vivo differentiation of adult stem cells is associated with small but informative changes in the genomic distribution of DNA methylation.},

TopHat2 can align reads of various lengths produced by the latest sequencing technologies, while allowing for variable-length indels with respect to the reference genome. In addition to de novo spliced alignment, TopHat2 can align reads across fusion breaks, which can occur after genomic translocations. TopHat2 combines the ability to identify novel splice sites with direct mapping to known transcripts, producing sensitive and accurate alignments, even for highly repetitive genomes or in the presence of pseudogenes.

abstract = {Cancer cells are distinguished from each other and from healthy cells by features that drive clonal evolution and therapy resistance. New advances in high-dimensional flow cytometry make it possible to systematically measure mechanisms of tumor initiation, progression, and therapy resistance on millions of cells from human tumors. Here we describe flow cytometry techniques that enable a “single-cell ” view of cancer. High-dimensional techniques like mass cytometry enable multiplexed single-cell analysis of cell identity, clinical biomarkers, signaling network phospho-proteins, transcription factors, and functional readouts of proliferation, cell cycle status, and apoptosis. This capability pairs well with a signaling profiles approach that dissects mechanism by systematically perturbing and measuring many nodes in a signaling network. Single-cell approaches enable study of cellular heterogeneity of primary tissues and turn cell subsets into experimental controls or opportunities for new discovery. Rare populations of stem cells or therapy-resistant cancer cells can be identified and compared to other types of cells within the same sample. In the long term, these techniques will enable tracking of minimal residual disease (MRD) and disease progression. By better understanding biological systems that control development and cell–cell interactions in healthy and diseased contexts, we can learn to program cells to become therapeutic agents or target malignant signaling events to specifically kill cancer cells. Single-cell approaches that provide deep insight into cell signaling and fate decisions will be critical to optimizing the next generation of cancer treatments combining targeted approaches and immunotherapy.},

To address this problem, we need scalable, cost-effective methods to obtain assemblies with chromosome-scale contiguity. Here we show that genome-wide chromatin interaction data sets, such as those generated by Hi-C, are a rich source of long-range information for assigning, ordering and orienting genomic sequences to chromosomes, including across centromeres. To exploit this finding, we developed an algorithm that uses Hi-C data for ultra-long-range scaffolding of de novo genome assemblies. We demonstrate the approach by combining shotgun fragment and short jump mate-pair sequences with Hi-C data to generate chromosome-scale de novo assemblies of the human, mouse and Drosophila genomes, achieving—for the human genome—98{\%} accuracy in assigning scaffolds to chromosome groups and 99{\%} accuracy in ordering and orienting scaffolds within chromosome groups. Hi-C data can also be used to validate chromosomal translocations in cancer genomes.},

Recent genomic data from AML cases using digital sequencing, temporal comparisons, xenograft cloning, and single-cell analysis indicate that most, if not all, AML cases emerge through branching evolution. According to a review of the current literature, the balanced translocations (t[15;17], t[8;21], and inv[16]) and nucleotide variants in DNMT3A and TET2 most commonly occur in the founding clone at diagnosis. These mutations are rarely gained or lost at relapse, and the latter 2 mutations are observed in elderly subjects with mosaic hematopoiesis antedating overt leukemia. In contrast, +8, +13, +22, –X, –Y, and nucleotide variants in FLT3, NRAS/KRAS, WT1, and KIT frequently occur in subclones and are observed either to emerge or to be lost at relapse. Because drugs that target mutations within a subclone are unlikely to eliminate all leukemic cells, it will be essential to understand not only which mutations a patient has but also how they organize within the leukemic subclonal architecture.},

abstract = {The balanced turnover of collagen is necessary to maintain the mechanical strength of pelvic supportive connective tissues. Homeobox (HOX) A11 is a key transcriptional factor that controls collagen metabolism and homoeostasis in the uterosacral ligaments (USLs), and the deficient HOXA11 signalling may contribute to alterations in the biochemical strength of the USLs, leading to pelvic organ prolapse (POP). However, it is unknown how HOXA11 transcripts are regulated in the USLs. In this study, we found that microRNA (miRNA)-30d and 181a were overexpressed in women with POP, and their expression was inversely correlated with HOXA11 mRNA levels. The overexpression of miR-30d or 181a suppressed HOXA11 mRNA and protein levels in 293T cells, whereas the knockdown of these miRNAs enhanced HOXA11 levels and collagen production. Cotransfection of a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the 3′-untranslated region of HOXA11 with miR-30d or 181a mimic resulted in decreased relative luciferase activity. Conversely, cotransfection with anti-miR-30d or 181a increased luciferase activity. Taken together, these results indicate that both miR-30d and 181a are important posttranscriptional regulators of HOXA11 in the USLs and could be a potential therapeutic target for POP.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification involved in many biological processes and diseases. Recent developments in whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) technology have enabled genome-wide measurements of DNA methylation at single base pair resolution. Many experiments have been conducted to compare DNA methylation profiles under different biological contexts, with the goal of identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Due to the high cost of WGBS experiments, many studies are still conducted without biological replicates. Methods and tools available for analyzing such data are very limited.
We develop a statistical method, DSS-single, for detecting DMRs from WGBS data without replicates. We characterize the count data using a rigorous model that accounts for the spatial correlation of methylation levels, sequence depth and biological variation. We demonstrate that using information from neighboring CG sites, biological variation can be estimated accurately even without replicates. DMR detection is then carried out via a Wald test procedure. Simulations demonstrate that DSS-single has greater sensitivity and accuracy than existing methods, and an analysis of H1 versus IMR90 cell lines suggests that it also yields the most biologically meaningful results. DSS-single is implemented in the Bioconductor package DSS.},

abstract = {Flow cytometry has become an essential tool for identification and characterization of hematological cancers and now, due to technological improvements, allows the identification and rapid enumeration of small tumor populations that may be present after induction therapy (minimal residual disease, MRD). The quantitation of MRD has been shown to correlate with relapse and survival rates in numerous diseases and in certain cases, and evidence of MRD is used to alter treatment protocols. Recent improvements in hardware allow for high data rate collection. Improved fluorochromes take advantage of violet laser excitation and maximize signal-to-noise ratio allowing the population of interest to be isolated in multiparameter space. This isolation, together with a low background rate, permits for detection of residual tumor populations in a background of normal cells. When counting such rare events, the distribution is governed by Poisson statistics, with precision increasing with higher numbers of cells collected. In several hematological malignancies, identification of populations at frequencies of 0.01{\%} and lower has been attained. The choice of antibodies used in MRD detection facilitates the definition of a fingerprint to identify abnormal populations throughout treatment. Tumor populations can change phenotype, and an approach that relies on ‘different from normal' has proven useful, particularly in the acute leukemias. Flow cytometry can and is used for detection of MRD in many hematological diseases; however, standardized approaches for specific diseases must be developed to ensure precise identification and enumeration that may alter the course of patient treatment.},

abstract = {Expression of microRNAs, a new class of noncoding RNAs that hybridize to target messenger RNA and regulate their translation into proteins, has been recently demonstrated to be altered in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Distinctive patterns of increased expression and/or silencing of multiple microRNAs (microRNA signatures) have been associated with specific cytogenetic and molecular subsets of AML. Changes in the expression of several microRNAs altered in AML have been shown to have functional relevance in leukemogenesis, with some microRNAs acting as oncogenes and others as tumor suppressors. Both microRNA signatures and a single microRNA (ie, miR-181a) have been shown to supply prognostic information complementing that gained from cytogenetics, gene mutations, and altered gene expression. Moreover, it has been demonstrated experimentally that antileukemic effects can be achieved by modulating microRNA expression by pharmacologic agents and/or increasing low endogenous levels of microRNAs with tumor suppressor function by synthetic microRNA oligonucleotides, or down-regulating high endogenous levels of leukemogenic microRNAs by antisense oligonucleotides (antagomirs). Therefore, it is reasonable to predict the development of novel microRNA-based therapeutic approaches in AML. We review herein results of current studies analyzing changes of microRNA expression in AML and discuss their potential biologic, diagnostic, and prognostic relevance.},

Although this editing recodes and alters functions of several mammalian genes, its most common targets are noncoding repeat sequences, indicating the involvement of this editing system in currently unknown functions other than recoding of protein sequences. Here we show that specific adenosine residues of certain microRNA (miRNA) precursors are edited by ADAR1 and ADAR2. Editing of pri-miR-142, the precursor of miRNA-142, expressed in hematopoietic tissues, resulted in suppression of its processing by Drosha. The edited pri-miR-142 was degraded by Tudor-SN, a component of RISC and also a ribonuclease specific to inosine-containing dsRNAs. Consequently, mature miRNA-142 expression levels increased substantially in ADAR1 null or ADAR2 null mice. Our results demonstrate a new function of RNA editing in the control of miRNA biogenesis.},

abstract = {Background
The expression of CD56 is considered a bad prognostic factor for overall survival, lower rates or short complete remission and extramedullary invasion but the results are controversial. The importance of validating new prognostic parameters in acute leukemias was the reason to investigate the CD56 expression in blast cells of patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

Methods
A cohort of 48 patients treated at Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre and diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia as classified by the French-American-British group (FAB) criteria using cell morphology, cytochemistry and flow cytometry were evaluated.

Results
Eight cases (16.7{\%}) were CD56 positive without correlation to age or gender. The highest incidence of CD56 positivity was in FAB subtypes M4 and M5. The death rate during induction was not significantly different between patients with and without CD56 expression (62.5{\%} vs. 27.5{\%}; p-value = 0.097). However, patients that expressed CD56 had significantly lower overall survival than those who did not (mean 4.0 months vs. 14.5 months; p-value = 0.03).

Conclusions
The data suggest that expression of CD56 in acute myeloid leukemia may be indicative of poor prognosis because it is associated with a shorter overall survival. The death rate during induction was not significantly different despite an apparent difference in proportions between groups.},

The k-means algorithm is best suited for implementing this operation because of its efficiency in clustering large data sets. However, working only on numeric values limits its use in data mining because data sets in data mining often contain categorical values. In this paper we present an algorithm, called k-modes, to extend the k-means  paradigm to categorical domains. We introduce new dissimilarity measures to deal with categorical objects, replace means of clusters with modes, and use a frequency based method to update modes in the clustering process to minimise the clustering cost function. Tested with the well known soybean disease data set the algorithm has demonstrated a very good classification performance. Experiments on a very large health insurance data set consisting of half a million records and 34 categorical attributes show that the algorithm is scalable in terms of ...},

We demonstrate the power of the approach by reconstructing the chromosomal organization of the gene space of barley, a large, complex and highly repetitive 5.1 Gb genome. We evaluate the robustness of the new assembly by comparison to a recently released physical and genetic framework of the barley genome, and to various genetically ordered sequence-based genotypic datasets.

abstract = {Although papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) displays strong heritability, no predisposing germ-line mutations have been found. We show that a common G/C polymorphism (rs2910164) within the pre-miR-146a sequence reduced the amount of pre- and mature miR-146a from the C allele 1.9- and 1.8-fold, respectively, compared with the G allele. This is matched by a similar decrease in the amount of each pre-miR generated from the corresponding pri-miR-146a in an in vitro processing reaction. The C allele also interfered with the binding of a nuclear factor to pre-miR-146a. The reduction in miR-146a led to less efficient inhibition of target genes involved in the Toll-like receptor and cytokine signaling pathway (TRAF6, IRAK1), and PTC1 (also known as CCDC6 or H4), a gene frequently rearranged with RET proto-oncogene in PTC. In an association study of 608 PTC patients and 901 controls, we found marked differences in genotype distribution of rs2910164 (P = 0.000002), the GC heterozygous state being associated with an increased risk of acquiring PTC (odds ratio = 1.62, P = 0.000007), and both homozygous states protective with odds ratio = 0.42 for the CC genotype (P = 0.003) and odds ratio = 0.69 for the GG genotype (P = 0.0006). Moreover, 4.7{\%} of tumors had undergone somatic mutations of the SNP sequence. Thus, our data suggest that a common polymorphism in pre-miR-146a affects the miR expression, contributes to the genetic predisposition to PTC, and plays a role in the tumorigenesis through somatic mutation. Preliminary evidence suggests that these effects are mediated through target genes whose expression is affected by the SNP status.},

abstract = {Background Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised learning technique that has been applied successfully in several fields, including signal processing, face recognition and text mining. Recent applications of NMF in bioinformatics have demonstrated its ability to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional data such as gene expression microarrays. Developments in NMF theory and applications have resulted in a variety of algorithms and methods. However, most NMF implementations have been on commercial platforms, while those that are freely available typically require programming skills. This limits their use by the wider research community. Results Our objective is to provide the bioinformatics community with an open-source, easy-to-use and unified interface to standard NMF algorithms, as well as with a simple framework to help implement and test new NMF methods. For that purpose, we have developed a package for the R/BioConductor platform. The package ports public code to R, and is structured to enable users to easily modify and/or add algorithms. It includes a number of published NMF algorithms and initialization methods and facilitates the combination of these to produce new NMF strategies. Commonly used benchmark data and visualization methods are provided to help in the comparison and interpretation of the results. Conclusions The NMF package helps realize the potential of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, especially in bioinformatics, providing easy access to methods that have already yielded new insights in many applications. Documentation, source code and sample data are available from CRAN.},

We used seven tags to multiplex an entire 96-well plate, and applied MCB to characterize human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) signaling dynamics and cell-to-cell communication, signaling variability between PBMCs from eight human donors, and the effects of 27 inhibitors on this system. For each inhibitor, we measured 14 phosphorylation sites in 14 PBMC types at 96 conditions, resulting in 18,816 quantified phosphorylation levels from each multiplexed sample. This high-dimensional, systems-level inquiry allowed analysis across cell-type and signaling space, reclassified inhibitors and revealed off-target effects. High-content, high-throughput screening with MCB should be useful for drug discovery, preclinical testing and mechanistic investigation of human disease.},

abstract = {Background:Advances in multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM) now allow for the independent detection of larger numbers of fluorochromes on individual cells, generating data with increasingly higher dimensionality. The increased complexity of these data has made it difficult to identify cell populations from high-dimensional FCM data using traditional manual gating strategies based on single-color or two-color displays.Methods:To address this challenge, we developed a novel program, FLOCK (FLOw Clustering without K), that uses a density-based clustering approach to algorithmically identify biologically relevant cell populations from multiple samples in an unbiased fashion, thereby eliminating operator-dependent variability.Results:FLOCK was used to objectively identify seventeen distinct B-cell subsets in a human peripheral blood sample and to identify and quantify novel plasmablast subsets responding transiently to tetanus and other vaccinations in peripheral blood. FLOCK has been implemented in the publically available Immunology Database and Analysis Portal—ImmPort (http://www.immport.org)—for open use by the immunology research community.Conclusions:FLOCK is able to identify cell subsets in experiments that use multiparameter FCM through an objective, automated computational approach. The use of algorithms like FLOCK for FCM data analysis obviates the need for subjective and labor-intensive manual gating to identify and quantify cell subsets. Novel populations identified by these computational approaches can serve as hypotheses for further experimental study. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Clinical Cytometry Society},

abstract = {Summary
We show that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) upregulate immune signaling in cancer through the viral defense pathway. In ovarian cancer (OC), DNMTis trigger cytosolic sensing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) causing a type I interferon response and apoptosis. Knocking down dsRNA sensors TLR3 and MAVS reduces this response 2-fold and blocking interferon beta or its receptor abrogates it. Upregulation of hypermethylated endogenous retrovirus (ERV) genes accompanies the response and ERV overexpression activates the response. Basal levels of ERV and viral defense gene expression significantly correlate in primary OC and the latter signature separates primary samples for multiple tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas into low versus high expression groups. In melanoma patients treated with an immune checkpoint therapy, high viral defense signature expression in tumors significantly associates with durable clinical response and DNMTi treatment sensitizes to anti-CTLA4 therapy in a pre-clinical melanoma model.},

The transcriptional programs that govern hematopoiesis have been investigated primarily by population-level analysis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which cannot reveal the continuous nature of the differentiation process. Here we applied single-cell RNA-sequencing to a population of hematopoietic cells in zebrafish as they undergo thrombocyte lineage commitment. By reconstructing their developmental chronology computationally, we were able to place each cell along a continuum from stem cell to mature cell, refining the traditional lineage tree. The progression of cells along this continuum is characterized by a highly coordinated transcriptional program, displaying simultaneous suppression of genes involved in cell proliferation and ribosomal biogenesis as the expression of lineage specific genes increases. Within this program, there is substantial heterogeneity in the expression of the key lineage regulators. Overall, the total number of genes expressed, as well as the total mRNA content of the cell, decreases as the cells undergo lineage commitment.},

However, double positive (DP) T cells expressing both CD4 and CD8 have been described in several pathological conditions as well as in normal individuals. DP T cells represent a heterogeneous population. Strong evidence indicates that in vivo terminally differentiated effector CD4 may acquire the $\alpha$-chain of CD8.

Particularly intriguing, a subset of DP T cells expressing high levels of both CD4 and CD8$\alpha$$\beta$ heterodimer (CD4hiCD8hi), has been identified in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders. While no definitive proof exists, it could be speculated that CD4hiCD8hi T cells may be endowed with auto-reactivity due to faulty thymic selection.},

abstract = {BackgroundIn multivariate distributions (for example, in 3- or more color flow cytometric datasets), it can become difficult or impossible to identify populations that differ between samples based only on a combination of univariate or bivariate displays. Indeed, it is possible that such differences can only be identified in “n”-dimensional space, where “n” is the number of parameters measured. Therefore, computer assisted identification of such differences is necessary. Such a method could be used to identify responses (i.e., by comparing cell samples before and after stimulation) in exquisite detail by allowing complete analysis of the collected data on only those events which have responded.MethodsMultivariate Probability Binning can be used to compare different datasets to identify the distance and statistical significance of a difference between the distributions. An intermediate step in the algorithm provides access to the actual locations within the n-dimensional comparison which are most different between the distributions. Gates based on collections of hyper-rectangular bins can then be applied to datasets, thereby selecting those events (or clusters of events) that are different between samples. We term this process Frequency Difference Gating.ResultsFrequency Difference Gating was used in several test scenarios to evaluate its utility. First, we compared PBMC subsets identified by solely by immunofluorescence staining: based on this training data set, the algorithm automatically generated an accurate forward and side-scatter gate to identify lymphocytes. Second, we applied the algorithm to identify subtle differences between CD4 memory subsets based on 8-color immunophenotyping data. The resulting 3-dimensional gate could resolve cells subsets much more frequent in one subset compared to the other; no combination of two-dimensional gates could accomplish this resolution. Finally, we used the algorithm to compare B cell populations derived from mice of different ages or strains, and found that the algorithm could find very subtle differences between the populations.ConclusionFrequency Difference Gating is a powerful tool that automates the process of identifying events comprising underlying differences between samples. It is not a clustering tool; it is not meant to identify subsets in multidimensional space. Importantly, this method may reveal subtle changes in small populations of cells, changes that only occur simultaneously in multiple dimensions in such a way that identification by univariate or bivariate analyses is impossible. Finally, the method may significantly aid in the analysis of high-order multivariate data (i.e., 6-12 color flow cytometric analyses), where identification of differences between datasets becomes so time-consuming as to be impractical.

abstract = {The nature and pace of genome mutation is largely unknown. Because standard methods sequence DNA from populations of cells, the genetic composition of individual cells is lost, de novo mutations in cells are concealed within the bulk signal and per cell cycle mutation rates and mechanisms remain elusive. Although single-cell genome analyses could resolve these problems, such analyses are error-prone because of whole-genome amplification (WGA) artefacts and are limited in the types of DNA mutation that can be discerned. We developed methods for paired-end sequence analysis of single-cell WGA products that enable (i) detecting multiple classes of DNA mutation, (ii) distinguishing DNA copy number changes from allelic WGA-amplification artefacts by the discovery of matching aberrantly mapping read pairs among the surfeit of paired-end WGA and mapping artefacts and (iii) delineating the break points and architecture of structural variants. By applying the methods, we capture DNA copy number changes acquired over one cell cycle in breast cancer cells and in blastomeres derived from a human zygote after in vitro fertilization. Furthermore, we were able to discover and fine-map a heritable inter-chromosomal rearrangement t(1;16)(p36;p12) by sequencing a single blastomere. The methods will expedite applications in basic genome research and provide a stepping stone to novel approaches for clinical genetic diagnosis.},

abstract = {Signaling from the T-cell receptor (TCR) conditions T-cell differentiation and activation, requiring exquisite sensitivity and discrimination. Using mass cytometry, a high-dimensional technique that can probe multiple signaling nodes at the single-cell level, we interrogate TCR signaling dynamics in control C57BL/6 and autoimmunity-prone nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, which show ineffective ERK activation after TCR triggering. By quantitating signals at multiple steps along the signaling cascade and parsing the phosphorylation level of each node as a function of its predecessors, we show that a small impairment in initial pCD3$\zeta$ activation resonates farther down the signaling cascade and results in larger defects in activation of the ERK1/2–S6 and I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ modules. This nonlinear property of TCR signaling networks, which magnifies small initial differences during signal propagation, also applies in cells from B6 mice activated at different levels of intensity. Impairment in pCD3$\zeta$ and pSLP76 is not a feedback consequence of a primary deficiency in ERK activation because no proximal signaling defect was observed in Erk2 KO T cells. These defects, which were manifest at all stages of T-cell differentiation from early thymic pre-T cells to memory T cells, may condition the imbalanced immunoregulation and tolerance in NOD T cells. More generally, this amplification of small initial differences in signal intensity may explain how T cells discriminate between closely related ligands and adopt strongly delineated cell fates.},

abstract = {Flow cytometry bioinformatics is the application of bioinformatics to flow cytometry data, which involves storing, retrieving, organizing, and analyzing flow cytometry data using extensive computational resources and tools. Flow cytometry bioinformatics requires extensive use of and contributes to the development of techniques from computational statistics and machine learning. Flow cytometry and related methods allow the quantification of multiple independent biomarkers on large numbers of single cells. The rapid growth in the multidimensionality and throughput of flow cytometry data, particularly in the 2000s, has led to the creation of a variety of computational analysis methods, data standards, and public databases for the sharing of results. Computational methods exist to assist in the preprocessing of flow cytometry data, identifying cell populations within it, matching those cell populations across samples, and performing diagnosis and discovery using the results of previous steps. For preprocessing, this includes compensating for spectral overlap, transforming data onto scales conducive to visualization and analysis, assessing data for quality, and normalizing data across samples and experiments. For population identification, tools are available to aid traditional manual identification of populations in two-dimensional scatter plots (gating), to use dimensionality reduction to aid gating, and to find populations automatically in higher dimensional space in a variety of ways. It is also possible to characterize data in more comprehensive ways, such as the density-guided binary space partitioning technique known as probability binning, or by combinatorial gating. Finally, diagnosis using flow cytometry data can be aided by supervised learning techniques, and discovery of new cell types of biological importance by high-throughput statistical methods, as part of pipelines incorporating all of the aforementioned methods.Open standards, data, and software are also key parts of flow cytometry bioinformatics. Data standards include the widely adopted Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) defining how data from cytometers should be stored, but also several new standards under development by the International Society for Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC) to aid in storing more detailed information about experimental design and analytical steps. Open data is slowly growing with the opening of the CytoBank database in 2010 and FlowRepository in 2012, both of which allow users to freely distribute their data, and the latter of which has been recommended as the preferred repository for MIFlowCyt-compliant data by ISAC. Open software is most widely available in the form of a suite of Bioconductor packages, but is also available for web execution on the GenePattern platform.},

We demonstrate the analysis, individually and as mixtures, of 95 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones that cover the 4.7-Mb human major histocompatibility complex region. We obtain accurate, haplotype-resolved, sequence motif maps hundreds of kilobases in length, resulting in a median coverage of 114× for the BACs. The final sequence motif map assembly contains three contigs. With an average distance of 9 kb between labels, we detect 22 haplotype differences. We also use the sequence motif maps to provide scaffolds for de novo assembly of sequencing data. Nanochannel genome mapping should facilitate de novo assembly of sequencing reads from complex regions in diploid organisms, haplotype and structural variation analysis and comparative genomics.},

Germ cells are vital for transmitting genetic information from one generation to the next and for maintaining the continuation of species. Here, we analyze the transcriptome of human primordial germ cells (PGCs) from the migrating stage to the gonadal stage at single-cell and single-base resolutions. Human PGCs show unique transcription patterns involving the simultaneous expression of both pluripotency genes and germline-specific genes, with a subset of them displaying developmental-stage-specific features. Furthermore, we analyze the DNA methylome of human PGCs and find global demethylation of their genomes. Approximately 10 to 11 weeks after gestation, the PGCs are nearly devoid of any DNA methylation, with only 7.8{\%} and 6.0{\%} of the median methylation levels in male and female PGCs, respectively. Our work paves the way toward deciphering the complex epigenetic reprogramming of the germline with the aim of restoring totipotency in fertilized oocytes.},

However, no previous report has described how PCR-based duplication-induced artifacts affect the accuracy of this method when measuring DNA methylation levels. For quantifying the effects of duplication-induced artifacts on methylome profiling when using ultra-trace amounts of starting material, we developed a novel method, namely quantitative RRBS (Q-RRBS), in which PCR-induced duplication is excluded through the use of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). By performing Q-RRBS on varying amounts of starting material, we determined that duplication-induced artifacts were more severe when small quantities of the starting material were used. However, through using the UMIs, we successfully eliminated these artifacts. In addition, Q-RRBS could accurately detect allele-specific methylation in absence of allele-specific genetic variants. Our results demonstrate that Q-RRBS is an optimal strategy for DNA methylation profiling of single cells or samples containing ultra-trace amounts of cells.},

Within the bone marrow, stem cells differentiate and give rise to diverse blood cell types and functions. Currently, hematopoietic progenitors are defined using surface markers combined with functional assays that are not directly linked with in vivo differentiation potential or gene regulatory mechanisms. Here, we comprehensively map myeloid progenitor subpopulations by transcriptional sorting of single cells from the bone marrow. We describe multiple progenitor subgroups, showing unexpected transcriptional priming toward seven differentiation fates but no progenitors with a mixed state. Transcriptional differentiation is correlated with combinations of known and previously undefined transcription factors, suggesting that the process is tightly regulated. Histone maps and knockout assays are consistent with early transcriptional priming, while traditional transplantation experiments suggest that in vivo priming may still allow for plasticity given strong perturbations. These data establish a reference model and general framework for studying hematopoiesis at single-cell resolution.},

abstract = {The heterogeneity of DNA methylation within a population of cells necessitates DNA methylome profiling at single-cell resolution. Recently, we developed a single-cell reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (scRRBS) technique in which we modified the original RRBS method by integrating all the experimental steps before PCR amplification into a single-tube reaction. These modifications enable scRRBS to provide digitized methylation information on ∼1 million CpG sites within an individual diploid mouse or human cell at single-base resolution. Compared with the single-cell bisulfite sequencing (scBS) technique, scRRBS covers fewer CpG sites, but it provides better coverage for CpG islands (CGIs), which are likely to be the most informative elements for DNA methylation. The entire procedure takes ∼3 weeks, and it requires strong molecular biology skills.},

abstract = {The faithful transmission of DNA methylation patterns through cell divisions is essential for the daughter cells to retain a proper cell identity. To achieve a comprehensive assessment of methylation fidelity, we implemented a genome-scale hairpin bisulfite sequencing approach to generate methylation data for DNA double strands simultaneously. We show here that methylation fidelity is increasing globally during differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and is particularly high in the promoter regions of actively expressed genes and positively correlated with active histone modification marks and binding of transcriptional factors. The majority of intermediately (40{\%}-60{\%}) methylated CpG dinucleotides are hemi-methylated and with low methylation fidelity, particularly in the differentiating mESCs. However, while 5-hmC and 5-mC tend to coexist, there is no significant correlation between 5hmC levels and methylation fidelity. Our findings may shed new light on our understanding of the origins of methylation variations and the mechanisms underlying DNA methylation transmission.},

@article{Macaulay2016,
abstract = {Summary
The transcriptional programs that govern hematopoiesis have been investigated primarily by population-level analysis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which cannot reveal the continuous nature of the differentiation process. Here we applied single-cell RNA-sequencing to a population of hematopoietic cells in zebrafish as they undergo thrombocyte lineage commitment. By reconstructing their developmental chronology computationally, we were able to place each cell along a continuum from stem cell to mature cell, refining the traditional lineage tree. The progression of cells along this continuum is characterized by a highly coordinated transcriptional program, displaying simultaneous suppression of genes involved in cell proliferation and ribosomal biogenesis as the expression of lineage specific genes increases. Within this program, there is substantial heterogeneity in the expression of the key lineage regulators. Overall, the total number of genes expressed, as well as the total mRNA content of the cell, decreases as the cells undergo lineage commitment.},
